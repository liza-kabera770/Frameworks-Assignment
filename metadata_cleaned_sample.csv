Materials and Methods: An analytical, cross-sectional, prospective study was conducted. Data were collected between January and March 2021, from health science undergraduate students attending Federico Villarreal National University in Peru. To calculate the sample size, a formula to estimate a proportion was applied using Stata 15 software (n = 527). The examined factors were faculty, year of study, gender, region, residence, living with parents, and having family members infected with COVID-19, which were analyzed using a logit model to identify the impact of the intervening variables with a significance of P < 0.05. Results: None of the variables studied were found to affect knowledge and perceptions regarding COVID-19 preventive measures among Peruvian health science students, with the following odds ratios (OR) obtained: faculty (OR = 0.96;95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.83–1.12), year of study (OR = 0.98;CI: 0.77–1.25), gender (OR = 1.12;CI: 0.54–2.28), region (OR = 1.32;CI: 0.35–4.78), residence (OR = 0.97;CI: 0.48–1.95), living with parents (OR = 1.5;CI: 0.52–4.39), and having infected family members (OR = 1.5;CI: 0.64–3.49).

Understanding the early transmission dynamics helps plan intervention strategies such as lockdowns that mitigate further spread, minimizing the adverse impact on humanity and the economy1-3. Exponential growth of infections was thought to be the defining feature of an epidemic in its initial growth phase4-7; any variation from an exponential growth was described by adjusting the parameters of the exponential model7,8. Here, we show that, contrary to common belief, early stages of extreme COVID-19 waves display an unbounded growth and finite-time singularity accompanying a hyperexponential power-law. The faster than exponential growth phase is hazardous and would entail stricter regulations. Such a power-law description allows us to characterize COVID-19 waves with single power-law exponents, better than piece-wise exponentials. Furthermore, we identify the presence of log-periodic patterns decorating the power-law growth. These log-periodic oscillations may enable better prediction of the finite-time singularity.

The developing prenatal brain is a highly dynamic tissue, but our understanding of key drivers of epigenetic variability across development is limited. We therefore assessed genomic methylation at over 39 million sites in the prenatal cortex using whole genome bisulfite sequencing and found loci and regions in which methylation levels are dynamic across development. We saw that DNAm at these loci was associated with nearby gene expression and enriched for enhancer chromatin states in prenatal brain tissue. Additionally, these loci were enriched for genes associated with psychiatric disorders and genes involved with neurogenesis. We also found autosomal differences in DNAm between the sexes during prenatal development, though these have less clear functional consequences. We lastly confirmed that the dynamic methylation at this critical period is specifically CpG methylation, with very low levels of CpH methylation.

BACKGROUND Dihydroergotamine (DHE) has long been used to treat migraine, but intravenous administration is invasive, frequently associated with adverse events (AEs), and not suitable for at-home administration. INP104 is an investigational drug device that delivers DHE mesylate to the upper nasal space using a Precision Olfactory Delivery technology and was developed to overcome the shortcomings of available DHE products. METHODS STOP 301 was an open-label, 24-week safety study, with a 28-week extension period. After a 28-day screening period where patients used their ""best usual care"" to treat migraine attacks, patients were given INP104 (1.45 mg) to self-administer nasally with self-recognized attacks. The primary objective of this study was to assess safety and tolerability, with a specific focus on nasal mucosa and olfactory function. Exploratory objectives included efficacy assessments of migraine measures and a patient acceptability questionnaire. RESULTS A total of 360 patients entered the 24-week treatment period, with 354 patients dosing at least once. INP104-related treatment-emergent AEs were reported by 36.7% (130/354) of patients, and 6.8% (24/354) discontinued treatment due to AEs over 24 weeks. No new safety signals were observed following delivery to the upper nasal space. Pain freedom, the most bothersome symptom freedom, and pain relief at 2 h post-INP104 were self-reported by 38.0% (126/332), 52.1% (173/332), and 66.3% (167/252) of patients, respectively. A low recurrence rate at 24 and 48 h was observed (7.1% [9/126] and 14.3% [18/126], respectively). Most patients found INP104 easy to use and preferred it over their current therapy.

METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 levels were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) of nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab specimens collected at baseline and clinical outcomes were recorded over 60 days from 1362 COVID-19 hospitalized patients enrolled in a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2/3 trial of sarilumab for COVID-19 (NCT04315298). RESULTS: In post-hoc analyses, higher baseline viral load, measured by both RT-qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) and log(10) copies/mL, was associated with greater supplemental oxygenation requirements and disease severity at study entry. Higher baseline viral load was associated with higher mortality, lower likelihood of improvement in clinical status and supplemental oxygenation requirements, and lower rates of hospital discharge.

In Romania, a country where health expenditure is among the lowest in Europe, palliative care has been mainly provided by charitable organizations. Despite the high number of children needing palliative care, there is scant literature and research available on paediatric palliative care in Romania. The study explores the viewpoints of various paediatric oncology providers with regard to paediatric palliative care provision in Romania. METHODS: Four mixed focus groups were conducted at four university-affiliated paediatric oncology centres located in three distinct Romanian regions (Bucuresti-llfov, Nord-Est and Nord-Vest). The focus groups were analyzed using thematic coding. RESULTS: For many healthcare professionals, emotional burden inherent to the profession; unhealthy work-life balance and understaffing were among the biggest barriers to the successful integration of pediatric palliative care. The lack of staff was attributed to a shortage of financial resources, and to the persisting cultural stigma surrounding palliative care and oncology. Also political turmoil was identified as an important obstacle to palliative care implementation. CONCLUSION: Significant barriers persist limiting the broader implementation of pediatric palliative care in Romania. In order to render palliative care in pediatric oncology more sustainable, more attention should be paid to the mental health care of healthcare professionals working in this field, to the development of mobile palliative care services and to the emigration of skilled medical staff.",2021-11-18,"Pacurari, Nadia; De Clercq, Eva; Dragomir, Monica; Colita, Anca; Wangmo, Tenzin; Elger, Bernice S.",BMC Palliat Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8598931/,,2021.0,233

In response to subsequent surges of patients, institutions have deployed, modified, and/or discontinued their workforce plans. OBJECTIVE: Using rapid qualitative methods, we sought to explore hospitalists’ experiences with workforce deployment, types of clinicians deployed, and challenges encountered with subsequent iterations of surge planning during the COVID-19 pandemic across a collaborative of hospital medicine groups. APPROACH: Using rapid qualitative methods, focus groups were conducted in partnership with the Hospital Medicine Reengineering Network (HOMERuN). We interviewed physicians, advanced practice providers (APP), and physician researchers about (1) ongoing adaptations to the workforce as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, (2) current struggles with workforce planning, and (3) evolution of workforce planning. KEY RESULTS: We conducted five focus groups with 33 individuals from 24 institutions, representing 52% of HOMERuN sites. A variety of adaptations was described by participants, some common across institutions and others specific to the institution’s location and context. Adaptations implemented shifted from the first waves of COVID patients to subsequent waves. Three global themes also emerged: (1) adaptability and comfort with dynamic change, (2) the importance of the unique hospitalist skillset for effective surge planning and redeployment, and (3) the lack of universal solutions. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital workforce adaptations to the COVID pandemic continued to evolve. While few approaches were universally effective in managing surges of patients, and successful adaptations were highly context dependent, the ability to navigate a complex system, adaptability, and comfort in a chaotic, dynamic environment were themes considered most critical to successful surge management. However, resource constraints and sustained high workload levels raised issues of burnout.

DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: This study was conducted among hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: We analysed all hospitalised patients with COVID-19 with available vaccination information captured in Brazil’s national electronic respiratory infection data system between 1 January 2020 and 23 June 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes were age-specific mortality rates of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 with and without recent inactivated trivalent influenza vaccination. RESULTS: A total of 53 752 clinically confirmed COVID-19 cases were analysed. Controlling for health facility of treatment, comorbidities as well as an extensive range of sociodemographic factors, patients who received a recent influenza vaccine experienced on average 7% lower odds of needing intensive care treatment (95% CI 0.87 to 0.98), 17% lower odds of requiring invasive respiratory support (95% CI 0.77 to 0.88) and 16% lower odds of death (95% CI 0.78 to 0.90). Protective effects were larger when the vaccine was administered after onset of symptoms as well as among younger patients. CONCLUSION: Patients with COVID-19 with recent inactivated influenza vaccination experience significantly better health outcomes than non-vaccinated patients in Brazil.

Simultaneously, zoological gardens have undergone a revolution in philosophy and design, resulting in a proliferation of “naturalistic” habitats. Complex environments such as these have been found to affect the behavior of captive animals favorably, including increasing reproductive and rearing success, encouraging the expression of species‐typical behavior patterns, and decreasing abnormal behaviors. In June 1988, Zoo Atlanta completed four naturalistic habitats for western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla). These new habitats afforded a unique opportunity to study the adaptation of lowland gorillas to novel, naturalistic habitats. During the first year of habitation, a total of 451 hours of data were collected on 11 gorillas housed in three harem groups. Focal animal sampling with a behavioral change scoring system was used to obtain information on behavior, substrate, environmental components utilized, and location in sun or shade. Instantaneous scans at 15 minute intervals provided information on location and behavior of all individuals. Adaptation to the environments was assessed by using the indices of: time spent manipulating objects across the course of the study, the percent of the habitats utilized, and the dispersal of individual animals over the habitats. Trends in these behaviors indicated that exploration of the environments significantly decreased, but that this decline in exploration took over six months to occur.

In the non-adaptive setting, the most widely used combinatorial objects are disjunct and list-disjunct matrices, which define incidence matrices of test schemes. Disjunct matrices allow the identification of the exact set of defectives, whereas list disjunct matrices identify a small superset of the defectives. Apart from the combinatorial guarantees, it is often of key interest to equip measurement designs with efficient decoding algorithms. The most efficient decoders should run in sublinear time in $n$, and ideally near-linear in the number of measurements $m$. In this work, we give several constructions with an optimal number of measurements and near-optimal decoding time for the most fundamental group testing tasks, as well as for central tasks in the compressed sensing and heavy hitters literature. For many of those tasks, the previous measurement-optimal constructions needed time either quadratic in the number of measurements or linear in the universe size.

This study aimed to identify the associations among BMSM between recent police harassment and psychosocial vulnerability, psychological distress, and depression measured six months later. Data come from the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 061 Study, a cohort study of BMSM recruited in 6 U.S. cities (Atlanta, GA, Boston, MA, Los Angeles, CA, New York, NY, San Francisco, CA, and Washington DC).

Digital interventions with continuously available support and personalized educational content may offer unique advantages for self-management and glycemic control. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we evaluated changes in glycemic control among participants with type 2 diabetes who enrolled in a digital diabetes management program. METHODS: The study employed a single-arm, retrospective design. A total of 950 participants with a hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) baseline value of at least 7.0% enrolled in the Vida Health Diabetes Management Program. The intervention included one-to-one remote sessions with a Vida provider and structured lessons and tools related to diabetes management. HbA(1c) was the primary outcome measure. Of the 950 participants, 258 (27.2%) had a follow-up HbA(1c) completed at least 90 days from program start. Paired t tests were used to evaluate changes in HbA(1c) between baseline and follow-up. Additionally, a cluster-robust multiple regression analysis was employed to evaluate the relationship between high and low program usage and HbA(1c) change. A repeated measures analysis of variance was used to evaluate the difference in HbA(1c) as a function of the measurement period (ie, pre-Vida enrollment, baseline, and postenrollment follow-up). RESULTS: We observed a significant reduction in HbA(1c) of –0.81 points between baseline (mean 8.68, SD 1.7) and follow-up (mean 7.88, SD 1.46; t(257)=7.71; P<.001). Among participants considered high risk (baseline HbA(1c)≥8), there was an average reduction of –1.44 points between baseline (mean 9.73, SD 1.68) and follow-up (mean 8.29, SD 1.64; t(139)=9.14; P<.001). Additionally, average follow-up HbA(1c) (mean 7.82, SD 1.41) was significantly lower than pre-enrollment HbA(1c) (mean 8.12, SD 1.46; F(2, 210)=22.90; P<.001) There was also significant effect of program usage on HbA(1c) change (β=–.60; P<.001) such that high usage was associated with a greater decrease in HbA(1c) (mean –1.02, SD 1.60) compared to low usage (mean –.61, SD 1.72). CONCLUSIONS: The present study revealed clinically meaningful improvements in glycemic control among participants enrolled in a digital diabetes management intervention.

flet5az0,MedRxiv,The effects of the first national lockdown in England on geographical inequalities in the evolution of COVID-19 case rates: An ecological study,10.1101/2021.11.09.21266122,medrxiv,"Background Socio-economic inequalities in COVID-19 case rates have been noted worldwide. Previous studies have compared case rates over set phases. There has been no analysis of how inequalities in cases changed overtime and were shaped by national mitigation strategies (e.g. lock downs). This paper provides the first analysis of the evolution of area-level inequalities in COVID-19 cases by deprivation levels in the first wave of the pandemic (January to July 2020) in England - with a focus on the effects of the first national lockdown (March - July 2020). Methods Weekly case rates per Middle Super Output Area (MSOA, n=4412) in England from 2020-03-15 to 2020-07-04 were obtained, and characteristics of local epidemics were calculated, e.g. the highest case rate per area. Simple linear and logistic regression analyses were employed to assess the association of these metrics with index of multiple deprivation (IMD). Local authority-level (n=309) cases were used similarly in a sensitivity analysis, as these data were available daily and extended further back in time. The impact of lockdown was assessed by comparing the cumulative case rate in the most deprived 20% of MSOAs to the least deprived 20%, for the periods before the lockdown, and by the end of lockdown. Findings Less deprived areas began recording COVID-19 cases earlier than more deprived areas and were more likely to have peaked by March 2020. More deprived areas case rates grew faster and peaked higher than less deprived areas. During the first national lockdown in the UK, the relative excess in case rates in the most deprived areas increased to 130% of that of the least deprived ones. Interpretation The pattern of disease spread in England confirm the hypothesis that initial cases of a novel infectious disease are likely to occur in more affluent communities, but more deprived areas will overtake them once national mitigation strategies begin, and bear the brunt of the total case load. The strict first national lockdown served to increase case rate inequalities in England.",2021-11-09,"Welsh, C. E.; Albani, V.; Matthews, F.

OBJECTIVE: To describe COVID-19 outcomes among people with IDD living in residential groups homes in the state of New York and the general population of New York State. METHODS: Data for people with IDD are from a coalition of organizations providing over half of the residential services for the state of New York, and from the New York State Department of Health. Analysis describes COVID-19 case rates, case-fatality, and mortality among people with IDD living in residential group homes and New York State through May 28, 2020. RESULTS: People with IDD living in residential group homes were at greater risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes: case rates - 7,841 per 100,000 for people with IDD compared to 1,910 for New York State; case-fatality - 15.0% for people with IDD compared to 7.9% for New York State; and mortality rate - 1,175 per 100,000 for people with IDD compared to 151 per 100,000 for New York State. Differences in cases and mortality rate were confirmed across regions of the state, but case-fatality rate was only higher for people with IDD in and around the New York City region.

Although Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is an effective weight loss procedure, there is a plateau in weight loss and most individuals remain obese. This plateau may be partly due to the decline in leptin resulting in a state of relative leptin insufficiency. The main objective of this study was to determine whether leptin administration to post-RYGB patients would promote further weight reduction. DESIGN AND METHODS This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study of 27 women who were at least 18 months post-RYGB and lost on average 30.8% of their presurgical body weight. Subjects received either leptin or placebo via subcutaneous injection twice daily for 16 weeks, then crossed over to receive the alternate treatment for 16 weeks. RESULTS Weight change after 16 weeks of placebo was not significantly different from that after 16 weeks of leptin. No changes were observed in percent fat mass, resting energy expenditure, thyroid hormones, or cortisol levels.

The contribution of BrC to total aerosol light absorption during the lockdown (13%–49%) was higher compared with the normal period (4%–29%). Mass absorption cross-sections (MAC) of specific organic aerosol (OA) factors were calculated from a ridge regression model. Of the primary OA (POA), coal combustion OA (CCOA) had the largest MACs at all tested wavelengths during both periods due to high molecular-weight BrC chromophores;that was followed by biomass burning OA (BBOA) and hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA). For secondary OA (SOA), the MACs of the less-oxidized oxygenated OA (OOA) species (LO-OOA) at λ = 370–590 nm were higher than those of more-oxidized OOA (MO-OOA) during both periods, presumably due to chromophore bleaching. The largest contributor to BrC absorption at the short wavelengths was CCOA during both periods, but BrC absorption by LO-OOA and MO-OOA became dominant at longer wavelengths during the lockdown. The estimated radiation forcing efficiency of BrC over 370–600 nm increased from 37.5 W· g-1 during the normal period to 50.2 W·g-1 during the lockdown, and that enhancement was mainly caused by higher MACs for both LO-OOA and MO-OOA.

fl06pd3t,Medline,COVID-19 in children: current evidence and key questions.,10.1097/qco.0000000000000690,unk,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW SARS-CoV-2 infection in children has been less well characterized than in adults, primarily due to a significantly milder clinical phenotype meaning many cases have gone undocumented by health professionals or researchers. This review outlines the current evidence of the epidemiology of infection in children, the clinical manifestations of disease, the role of children in transmission of the virus and the recently described hyperinflammatory syndrome observed later during the first phase of the pandemic. RECENT FINDINGS International seroprevalence studies have found younger children to have lower prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, indicating they have not been infected as much as adults. This may be due to shielding by school closures, or by a reduced susceptibility to infection, as indicated by a significantly lower attack rate in children than adults in household contact tracing studies. The most well recognized symptoms in adults of cough, fever, anosmia and ageusia are less frequent in children, who may often present with mild and nonspecific symptoms, or with gastrointestinal symptoms alone. Risk factors for severe disease in children include chronic lung, cardiac or neurological disease, and malignancy. However, the absolute risk still appears very low for these cohorts. A new hyperinflammatory syndrome has emerged with an apparent immune cause.

Electrocardiography (ECG) is a noninvasive screening tool for cardiac electrophysiological activities that has been used to detect patients with low EF based on a deep learning model (DLM) trained via large amounts of data. However, no studies have widely investigated its clinical impacts. OBJECTIVE: This study developed a DLM to estimate EF via ECG (ECG-EF). We further investigated the relationship between ECG-EF and echo-based EF (ECHO-EF) and explored their contributions to future cardiovascular adverse events. METHODS: There were 57,206 ECGs with corresponding echocardiograms used to train our DLM. We compared a series of training strategies and selected the best DLM. The architecture of the DLM was based on ECG12Net, developed previously. Next, 10,762 ECGs were used for validation, and another 20,629 ECGs were employed to conduct the accuracy test. The changes between ECG-EF and ECHO-EF were evaluated. The primary follow-up adverse events included future ECHO-EF changes and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). RESULTS: The sex-/age-matching strategy-trained DLM achieved the best area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9472 with a sensitivity of 86.9% and specificity of 89.6% in the follow-up cohort, with a correlation of 0.603 and a mean absolute error of 7.436. In patients with accurate prediction (initial difference < 10%), the change traces of ECG-EF and ECHO-EF were more consistent (R-square = 0.351) than in all patients (R-square = 0.115). Patients with lower ECG-EF (≤35%) exhibited a greater risk of cardiovascular (CV) complications, delayed ECHO-EF recovery, and earlier ECHO-EF deterioration than patients with normal ECG-EF (>50%). Importantly, ECG-EF demonstrated an independent impact on MACEs and all CV adverse outcomes, with better prediction of CV outcomes than ECHO-EF. CONCLUSIONS: The ECG-EF could be used to initially screen asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) and it could also independently contribute to the predictions of future CV adverse events. Although further large-scale studies are warranted, DLM-based ECG-EF could serve as a promising diagnostic supportive and management-guided tool for CV disease prediction and the care of patients with LVD.",2022-03-13,"Chen, Hung-Yi; Lin, Chin-Sheng; Fang, Wen-Hui; Lou, Yu-Sheng; Cheng, Cheng-Chung; Lee, Chia-Cheng; Lin, Chin",J Pers Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm12030455; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35330455/,247463832.0,2022.0,340

In Spain, the state of alarm was established from March 15 to June 20, 2020. Usually this fact decreased people's mobility and physical activity, in addition to producing or exacerbating psychological disorders. Our aim was to determine the influence that this condition had over the short-term ponderal results of patients undergoing laparoscopic vertical gastrectomy from May 2019 to May 2020. METHODS: Case-control study for comparing the percentage of excess weight lost (%EWL) and the percentage of total weight lost (%TWL) of patients that underwent a VG during the last year, so they were affected by lockdown in April and part of March 2020 (group 1), to the %EWL and %TWL of a control group (group 2), obtained from our previous series. RESULTS: The mean %EWL in group 1 is 47,37 ± 18,59 and in group 2 is 51,13 ± 17,59, being p = 0,438. Meanwhile, the mean %TWL in group 1 is 21,14 ± 8,17 and in group 2 is 24,67 ± 8,01, with p = 0,115.

Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cell populations were characterized, together with the pattern of virus replication and appearance of antibodies in the lungs. Total BAL cell numbers increased from 140x10(6) at 5 days p.i. to 948x10(6) at 25 days p.i. and remained at high levels until the end of the experiment. The number of monocytes/macrophages, as identified by monoclonal antibodies 74-22-15 and 41D3, increased two- to fivefold between 9 and 52 days p.i. with a maximum at 25 days p.i. Flow cytometry showed that the population of differentiated macrophages was reduced between 9 and 20 days p.i. and that between the same time interval, both 74-22-15-positive and 41D3-negative cells, presumably monocytes, and 74-22-15- and 41D3-double negative cells, presumably non-phagocytes, entered the alveolar spaces. Virus replication was highest at 7 to 9 days p.i., decreased slowly thereafter and was detected until 40 days p.i. Anti-PRRSV antibodies were detected starting at 9 days p.i. but neutralizing antibodies were only demonstrated in one pig euthanized at 35 days and another at 52 days p.i. The decrease of virus replication in the lungs from 9 days p.i. can be attributed to (i) shortage of susceptible differentiated macrophages, (ii) lack of susceptibility of the newly infiltrated monocytes and (iii) appearance of anti-PRRSV antibodies in the lungs.

kb3ir9o0,Medline,Is heat pain detection threshold associated with the area of secondary hyperalgesia following brief thermal sensitization? A study of healthy volunteers - design and detailed plan of analysis.,10.1186/s12871-016-0193-2,cc-by,"BACKGROUND Several factors are believed to influence the development and experience of pain. Human clinical pain models are central tools, in the investigation of basic physiologic pain responses, and can be applied in patients as well as in healthy volunteers. Each clinical pain model investigates different aspects of the human pain response. Brief thermal sensitization induces a mild burn injury, resulting in development of primary hyperalgesia at the site of stimulation, and secondary hyperalgesia surrounding the site of stimulation. Central sensitization is believed to play an important role in the development of secondary hyperalgesia; however, a possible association of secondary hyperalgesia following brief thermal sensitization and other heat pain models remains unknown. Our aim with this study is to investigate how close the heat pain detection threshold is associated with the size of the area of secondary hyperalgesia induced by the clinical heat pain model: Brief thermal sensitization. METHODS AND DESIGN We aim to include 120 healthy participants. The participants will be tested on two separate study days with the following procedures: i) Brief thermal sensitization, ii) heat pain detection threshold and iii) pain during thermal stimulation. Additionally, the participants will be tested with the Pain Catastrophizing Scale and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale questionnaires. We conducted statistical simulations based on data from our previous study, to estimate an empirical power of 99.9 % with α of 0.05. We define that an R(2) < 0.25 and predictive intervals larger than +/-150 cm(2) are indications of a weak association. DISCUSSION The area of secondary hyperalgesia may serve as a quantitative measure of the central sensitization induced by cutaneous heat stimulation, and thus may be a biomarker of an individual's pain sensitivity. The number of studies investigating secondary hyperalgesia is growing; however basic knowledge of the physiologic aspects of secondary hyperalgesia in humans is still incomplete. We therefore find it interesting to investigate if HPDT, a known quantitative sensory test, is associated with areas of secondary hyperalgesia following brief thermal sensitization TRIAL REGISTRATION Clinicaltrials.gov (Identifier: NCT02527395 ).

x7nxompw,Medline; PMC,Equivalent Impedance Models for Electrochemical Nanosensor-Based Integrated System Design,10.3390/s21093259,cc-by,"Models of electrochemical sensors play a critical role for electronic engineers in designing electrochemical nanosensor-based integrated systems and are also widely used in analyzing chemical reactions to model the current, electrical potential, and impedance occurring at the surface of an electrode. However, the use of jargon and the different perspectives of scientists and electronic engineers often result in different viewpoints on principles of electrochemical models, which can impede the effective development of sensor technology. This paper is aimed to fill the knowledge gap between electronic engineers and scientists by providing a review and an analysis of electrochemical models. First, a brief review of the electrochemical sensor mechanism from a scientist’s perspective is presented. Then a general model, which reflects a more realistic situation of nanosensors is proposed from an electronic engineer point of view and a comparison between the Randles Model is given with its application in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and general sensor design. Finally, with the help of the proposed equivalent model, a cohesive explanation of the scan rate of cyclic voltammetry is discussed. The information of this paper can contribute to enriching the knowledge of electrochemical sensor models for scientists and is also able to guide the electronic engineer on designing next-generation sensor layouts.",2021-05-08,"Wang, Zhongzheng; Murphy, Aidan; O’Riordan, Alan; O’Connell, Ivan",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34066740/; https://doi.org/10.3390/s21093259,234743704.0,2021.0,206

Interferons have direct antiviral and immunomodulatory effects. Antiviral effects may include inhibition of viral replication, protein synthesis, virus maturation, or virus release from infected cells. Previous studies have shown that some coronaviruses are susceptible to interferons. The aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic effects of IFN-β-1a administration in COVID-19. METHODS: In this prospective non-controlled trial, 20 patients included. They received IFN-β-1a at a dose of 44 µg subcutaneously every other day up to 10 days. All patients received conventional therapy including Hydroxychloroquine, and lopinavir/ritonavir. Demographic data, clinical symptoms, virological clearance, and imaging findings recorded during the study. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 58.55 ± 13.43 years. Fever resolved in all patients during first seven days. Although other symptoms decreased gradually. Virological clearance results showed a significant decrease within 10 days. Imaging studies showed significant recovery after 14-day period in all patients. The mean time of hospitalization was 16.8 ± 3.4 days. There were no deaths or significant adverse drug reactions in the 14-day period. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the use of IFN-β-1a in combination with hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir in the management of COVID-19.

OBJECTIVE We hypothesised that the effect of phenylephrine on cardiac output is affected by preload dependency. DESIGN A prospective observational study. SETTING Single-centre, University Hospital of Caen, France. PATIENTS Fifty ventilated patients undergoing surgery were studied during hypotension before and after administration of phenylephrine. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Cardiac index (CI), stroke volume (SV), corrected flow time, mean arterial pressure, pulse pressure variations (PPV) and systemic vascular resistance index were used to assess effects of changes in preload dependency. RESULTS Twenty seven (54%) patients were included in the preload-dependent group (PPV ≥ 13%) and 23 (46%) in the preload-independent group (PPV < 13%) before administration of phenylephrine. For the whole cohort, phenylephrine increased mean arterial pressure [58 (±8) mmHg vs. 79 (±13) mmHg; P < 0.0001] and calculated systemic vascular resistance index [2010 (1338; 2481) dyn s cm m vs. 2989 (2155; 3870) dyn s cm m; P < 0.0001]. However, CI and SV decreased in the preload-independent group [2.3 (1.9; 3.7) l min m vs. 1.8 (1.5; 2.7) l min m; P < 0.0001 and 65 (44; 81) ml vs. 56 (39; 66) ml; P < 0.0001 for both] but not in the preload-dependent group [respectively 2.1 (1.8; 3.5) l min m vs. 2.1 (1.8; 3.3) l min m; P = 0.168 and 49 (41; 67) ml vs. 53 (41; 69) ml; P = 0.191].

The need to continue offering physical exercise to individuals after stroke became an emergency. However, these individuals may have barriers to adhere to the programs delivered remotely. There is a lack of evidence related to adherence, attendance, safety, and satisfaction of remote exercise programs for this population. Objective: The aim was to evaluate adherence and barriers to attend a remote physical exercise program for individuals after stroke. We aimed (a) to identify adherence and attendance rate of the remote physical exercise program (i.e., number of participants engaged, number of sessions attended, and exercise time in remote program); (b) to identify the safety of a remote physical exercise program (i.e., falls, pain, or dizziness when performing the exercises, fear, or insecurity); and (c) to identify the overall experience to participate in a remote program. Materials and methods: This is a longitudinal study, including 36 stroke survivors who already attended a face-to-face physical exercise program prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The remote physical exercise program included sessions for 2 days/week for a duration of 22 weeks, with a total of 44 sessions, which were delivered asynchrony via recorded video sessions. As outcome measures, we performed two questionnaires (via weekly telephone calls) to identify attendance, barriers, safety, and overall experience related to the program. Results: The adherence rate was 86 (9%). The attendance rate was 19, with a total of 8 sessions (108.3 min/week). The main barriers for lower attendance rate were as follows: lack of motor skills and physical fitness to workout in 80 reports (20.6%), followed by no exercise companion in 44 reports (11.3%). The remote physical program has been shown to be safe, and the overall experience was positive from the perspectives of the participants and the family members. Conclusion: Although the adherence rate was high, the attendance rate was low on the remote physical exercise program. The main barriers to attending the program remotely reflect the need of tailoring individually an asynchrony mode of delivering the sessions to individuals after stroke. Our results also indicate how the COVID-19 impacted the health conditions of stroke survivors.

We evaluated a self-designed, low-cost, patient-specific acetabular jig to guide cup placement in total hip arthroplasty in comparison to conventional technique. METHODS: It was a prospective randomized control study. Thirty-six patients were categorized into group-A & group-B. In group-A, virtually designed acetabular jig was 3 Dimensional (3D) printed and used intra-operatively to guide cup placement. In group-B, the standard method of cup placement was used. Acetabular cup placement was evaluated on post-operative x-rays and compared between two groups. RESULTS: In group-A, angle of anteversion were significantly in centre of range of safe zone as compared to group B in which hip is maximally stable with more precision in creating hip centre as compared to group-B without any significant(p = 0.325) increase in surgical time or blood loss. CONCLUSION: Computed tomography (CT) scan based virtual pre-operative templating and cup placement guided by virtually designed, patient-specific acetabular jig is a low-cost tool with a short learning curve which can be designed and made available easily. It is a useful tool in decreasing chances of malpositioning of cup and recreates hip centre close to anatomical one especially in cases where anatomy has been distorted such as bony ankylosis and developmental dysplasia of hip.",2020-03-17,"Mishra, Abhishek; Verma, Tarun; Rajkumar; Agarwal, Gaurang; Sharma, Amit; Maini, Lalit",Indian J Orthop,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7096340/,,2020.0,235

Methods: Patients with a positive diagnosis of COVID-19 and OD were prospectively recruited from March 22 to December 15, 2020 from 4 European hospitals. Patients had confirmed OD on psychophysical testing. All patients undertook OT, with add-on 10 days of OC (group 1: OC + OT), or 1 month of NC (group 2: NC + OT) or olfactory training alone (group 3: OT). Olfactory evaluations (Sniffin’Sticks tests) were carried out at the time of inclusion, 1 and 2 months after the start of the therapeutic course. Results: A total of 152 hyposmic or anosmic patients completed the study. Group 1, 2 and 3 included 59, 22 and 71 patients, respectively and all patient groups were comparable regarding baseline Sniffin’Sticks tests. The median Sniffin’Sticks test values significantly improved from pre- to post-intervention in all groups. The increase of Sniffin’Sticks test values was higher in group 1 (OC + OT) compared with groups 2 and 3 (p &lt;0.001) at one month after treatment but did not remain so at 2 months. Groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively, presented parosmia in 20/71 (28.2%), 9/22 (40.9%) and 42/71 (59.2%) patients. This difference was statistically significant between group 1 and 3 (p &lt;0.001). There were no patients with a worsening of the disease or an increase of the severity of the COVID-19 symptoms. Conclusions: The use of OCs in patients with OD related to mild COVID-19 is generally well-tolerated without any case of deterioration of symptoms. OC is associated with greater improvement in psychophysical olfactory evaluations at 1-month post-treatment but there was no difference at 2 months. Parosmia may be reduced following treatment with OC and NC. On the basis of these preliminary results, it is possible to state that considering the 2 months efficacy of OC and NC with respect to the OT alone and the risk-benefit ratio, the benefit to start a specific treatment of COVID-19 related OD cannot be demonstrated and there is a need for a randomised controlled trial to assess this further.",,"Saussez, Sven Vaira Luigi Angelo Chiesa-Estomba Carlos M.; Bon, Serge-D.

Models have focused primarily on the reproductive numbers of the disease that represent the average number of secondary infections produced by a random infectious individual. However, these population-level estimates may conflate important systematic variation in the number of cases generated by infected individuals, particularly found in spatially localized transmission and superspreading events. Although superspreading features prominently in first-hand narratives of Ebola transmission, its dynamics have not been systematically characterized, hindering refinements of future epidemic predictions and explorations of targeted interventions. We used Bayesian model inference to integrate individual-level spatial information with other epidemiological data of community-based (undetected within clinical-care systems) cases and to explicitly infer distribution of the cases generated by each infected individual. Our results show that superspreaders play a key role in sustaining onward transmission of the epidemic, and they are responsible for a significant proportion ([Formula: see text]61%) of the infections. Our results also suggest age as a key demographic predictor for superspreading. We also show that community-based cases may have progressed more rapidly than those notified within clinical-care systems, and most transmission events occurred in a relatively short distance (with median value of 2.51 km). Our results stress the importance of characterizing superspreading of Ebola, enhance our current understanding of its spatiotemporal dynamics, and highlight the potential importance of targeted control measures.",,"Lau, Max S Y; Dalziel, Benjamin Douglas; Funk, Sebastian; McClelland, Amanda; Tiffany, Amanda; Riley, Steven; Metcalf, C Jessica E; Grenfell, Bryan T",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1614595114; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28193880/,4775398.0,,250

SARS-CoV-2-mediated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is strongly associated with the rampant of infection with catastrophic morbidity. This pandemic has jiggled the society with its widespread social, psychologic, and economic distress. Society immunity or herd immunity is the most crucial and natural prophylactic vaccination interference against any infectious disease around the globe. It postulates protection at both the individual and population levels against pathogen-borne infections. The accomplishment of herd immunity is reliant upon the transmission efficiency of pathogens and the emerging natural immunity within a society. This is an exclusively pertinent mechanism to control any pandemic. The microbiome plays a crucial role in the coevolution of the body's immune cells, which are cardinal for bolstering a proficient vaccination process, ensuring herd immunity. The dynamics of interaction among microbiota, nutrients, and individual immunity determines the avidity of vaccines against several pathogens. Synchronization of microbial symbiosis preserves pathogen transmissibility and the engrossment of vaccination among different clusters based on the age and gender. Imbalance of nutrients refutes microbiome harmony, develops environmental enteropathy, and exacerbates immunity, which perturbs the efficacy of the vaccination process. Furthermore, discrepancies in the protective response of many vaccines in developing countries than developed countries are due to differences in healthy microbiota among the individuals in a particular cohort. We suggested that the rigorous pan-India oral poliovirus vaccination program for the past 30years has been finally capable of inducing herd immunity against poliovirus infection among societies, which may also inspire the commencement of natural heterologous immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Cloud computing systems, also known as a solution that offloads energy-consuming computation of IoT applications to a cloud server, cannot meet the delay-sensitive and context-aware service requirements. To address this issue, an edge computing system provides timely and context-aware services by bringing the computations and storage closer to the user. The dynamic flow of requests that can be efficiently processed is a significant challenge for edge and cloud computing systems. To improve the performance of IoT systems, the mobile edge orchestrator (MEO), which is an application placement controller, was designed by integrating end mobile devices with edge and cloud computing systems. In this paper, we propose a flexible computation offloading method in a fuzzy-based MEO for IoT applications in order to improve the efficiency in computational resource management. Considering the network, computation resources, and task requirements, a fuzzy-based MEO allows edge workload orchestration actions to decide whether to offload a mobile user to local edge, neighboring edge, or cloud servers. Additionally, increasing packet sizes will affect the failed-task ratio when the number of mobile devices increases. To reduce failed tasks because of transmission collisions and to improve service times for time-critical tasks, we define a new input crisp value, and a new output decision for a fuzzy-based MEO. Using the EdgeCloudSim simulator, we evaluate our proposal with four benchmark algorithms in augmented reality, healthcare, compute-intensive, and infotainment applications. Simulation results show that our proposal provides better results in terms of WLAN delay, service times, the number of failed tasks, and VM utilization.",2020-11-25,"Nguyen, VanDung; Khanh, Tran Trong; Nguyen, Tri D.

axcspi5v,Medline,Glycoconjugate glycans as viral receptors.,,unk,"The carbohydrate parts of cell surface glycoproteins, glycolipids, and proteoglycans constitute receptors for many enveloped as well as non-enveloped human viruses. The majority of viral receptors of carbohydrate nature are negatively charged, including sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) or glycans containing sialic acid. Not uncommonly, virus-carbohydrate interactions are responsible for specific tissue tropism, where the affinity of influenza virus for glycans in the respiratory tract containing (a2-6)-linked sialic acid is an important example. Similarly, the number and spacing of sulfates may guide viruses to optimal GAG molecules, although this remains unproven on tissue level. A further understanding of structure and tissue distribution of carbohydrate virus receptors and their viral ligands is essential for elucidating the pathogenesis of such viruses. Also neutral glycans such as histo-blood group substances may function as virus receptors. Here, natural resistance to a given viral disease may occur in a human subpopulation due to lack of such receptors caused by deletion-mutants in critical human genes. As regards antiviral applications, the receptor-destroying enzymes, in contrast to receptor binding proteins, at the surface of, for example, influenza virus have proven to be an excellent target for intervention, which is why sialic acid analogues are now in clinical use both for prophylaxis and treatment.",,"Olofsson, Sigvard; Bergström, Tomas",Annals of medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16019714/,25350863.0,,203

We examined the impact of an integrative medicine (IM) intervention for HCPs working in isolated COVID-19 in-patient departments, addressing concerns and wellbeing. Methods HCPs working in 3 isolated COVID-19 in-patient departments underwent 40-minute IM treatment sessions (including acupuncture, manual-movement and/or mind-body modalities) provided by integrative oncology practitioners. The MYCAW (Measure Yourself Concerns and Well-being) questionnaire was used to address the two leading concerns and post-treatment reflections and narrative. Data were qualitatively analyzed using ATLAS.Ti software for systematic coding. Results A total of 181 HCPs underwent 305 IM treatments. Narrative themes focused on physical symptoms (primarily pain and fatigue) and emotional concerns, including perceived communication barriers with patients;and reflections on wellbeing and insights following IM treatments. HCPs reported feeling a sense of ""relief"" which was likely related to the 3 main effects of the IM intervention: a sense of ""being cared for"" and treated;experiencing emotional, sometimes spiritual effects of the treatment;and the feeling of relaxation, combined with the relief of pain.

Using antibody-hemoglobin complexes, the test identifies human hemoglobin in a stool sample with a sensitivity of 74% and specificity of 94%1,2. A positive FIT test requires a follow-up colonoscopy for the detection and removal of pre-cancerous lesions. During the fiscal year (FY) 2020, 62% of returned FIT kits at the Veterans Administration Hospital were sent back incorrectly. This inefficiency led to increased cost/wasted product, delay in cancer detection, and dissatisfaction for patients and providers alike. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic urged social distancing measures, which increase FIT kit usage since in-person colonoscopies were deferred. Methods: The ambulatory quality improvement project sought out root causes for the incorrectly returned FITs and proposed PDSA cycles based on a series of approved action plans. The multidepartment team composed of individuals from lab, nursing, administrative staff, and primary care came together virtually and discovered 6 major root causes. The 80/20 rule was applied to our pareto chart of root concerns and a frequency vs risk chart was made to highlight our major problems. Our assessment showed that lack of written collection date was the biggest issue and thus a PICK chart was assembled to prioritize our future solutions. Our multi-pronged PDSA (Plan, Do, Study, Act) cycle attempted to set up redundant patient reminders, centralize the FIT dispersal process and make the patient-FIT interface more user-friendly. All our PDSA solutions were implemented over the course of 4 months. Results: Preliminary data has shown that the average percentage of incorrectly returned FITs due to lack of written collection date has decreased by 38.56% as of May 2021. Conclusion: As with any quality improvement process, an overhaul in process can bring up new issues. Due to frequent assessments through this project, we were able to troubleshoot a number of human factor engineering issues that arose between staff and FIT kits.

Particularly worrisome are the high contagiousness of the virus and the saturation of hospitals’ capacity due to overwhelming caseloads. Non-pharmaceutical interventions such as quarantine and inter-personal distancing are crucial to limiting the spread of the virus in the general population, but more tailored interventions may be needed at an individual level on a case-by-case basis. In this perspective, the most insidious situation is when an individual has contact with a contagious subject without adequate protection. If rapidly recognized afterwards, this occurrence may be promptly addressed through a post-exposure chemoprophylaxis (PEP) with antiviral drugs. This strategy has been implemented for other respiratory viruses (influenza above all) and was successfully used in South Korea among healthcare workers against the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, by providing people who were exposed to high-risk contacts with lopinavir-ritonavir plus ribavirin.

Here we investigate sex-based differences in the molecular mechanisms of anticancer immune-response and immune evasion in patients with NSCLC. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN We analyzed a) transcriptome-data of 2575 early-stage NSCLCs from 7 different datasets; b) 327 tumor-samples extensively characterized at the molecular level from the TRACERx lung study; c) two independent cohorts of respectively 329 and 391 patients with advanced NSCLC treated with anti-PD1/anti-PDL1 drugs. RESULTS As compared with men, the tumor microenvironment (TME) of women was significantly enriched for a number of innate and adaptive immune cell-types, including specific T-cell subpopulations. NSCLCs of men and women exploited different mechanisms of immune evasion. The TME of females was characterized by significantly greater T-cell dysfunction status, higher expression of inhibitory immune-checkpoint molecules and higher abundance of immune-suppressive cells, including Cancer Associated Fibroblasts, MDSCs and Regulatory T-cells. By contrast, the TME of males was significantly enriched for a T-cells excluded phenotype. We reported data supporting impaired neoantigens presentation to immune system in tumors of men, as molecular mechanism explaining the findings observed. Finally, in line with our results, we showed significant sex-based differences in the association between TMB and outcome of patients with advanced NSCLC treated with anti-PD1/PDL1 drugs.

bd34s04w,Medline,Intravenous ozonized saline therapy as prophylaxis for healthcare workers (HCWs) in a dedicated COVID-19 hospital in India - A retrospective study.,10.26355/eurrev_202105_25847,unk,"OBJECTIVE In the current pandemic, Health Care Workers (HCWs) are at a high risk of developing COVID-19. Preventive methods like the use of personal protective equipment, isolation, social distancing, and chemoprophylaxis show limited benefit. Despite standard prophylaxis, many of the HCWs develop COVID-19. Medical ozone therapy has immunomodulatory, antioxidant and antiviral effect, and, therefore, it can be explored as prophylaxis for COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS We conducted a retrospective controlled cohort study. IV ozonized saline was administered once a day for a total of 4 days in one month in addition to standard prophylaxis for COVID-19 to HCWs in a dedicated COVID hospital. Fresh ozonized saline was prepared for every administration and was given over 1 hour. RESULTS There were 235 HCWs, 64 received the ozone prophylaxis and 171 did not. The incidence of COVID-19 was significantly (p=0.04) lesser in HCWs that received ozone prophylaxis (4.6%) as compared to those who did not (14.03%). The benefit was seen irrespective of the risk of exposure. In the red zone, 8.69% of the HCWs who received ozone prophylaxis tested positive as opposed to 15.3% of those who did not. In the orange zone, 4.34% of the HCWs who received ozone prophylaxis tested positive, remarkably lesser than those who did not (20%). In the green zone, none of the HCWs who received ozone prophylaxis tested positive; however, 3.4% of the HCWs who did not receive ozone prophylaxis tested positive. No major adverse events were noted. CONCLUSIONS IV ozonized saline can be used in addition to the standard prophylactic regimen for the prevention of COVID-19 in HCWs. Prospective larger studies are required to establish the potency of IV ozonized saline as prophylaxis.",2021-05-01,"Sharma, A; Shah, M; Sane, H; Gokulchandran, N; Paranjape, A; Khubchandani, P; Captain, J; Shirke, S; Kulkarni, P",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202105_25847; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34002840/,234770876.0,2021.0,278
fpzqfqn2,WHO,Life in lockdown: experiences of patients with IBD during COVID-19,,unk,"OBJECTIVE: COVID-19 has disrupted the normal way of life in the UK, but for some patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the impact of this unprecedented global emergency was far greater. We aimed to assess the experience of patients with IBD during the COVID-19 lockdown. DESIGN: We designed a survey focused on the impact of COVID-19 on IBD healthcare, social and psychological well-being and quality of life. To capture those most likely to be affected we targeted survey invitations at our British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) defined high and moderate-risk IBD population. Access to the survey was also available via our trust's social media pages. RESULTS: 685 responses were received. 76% of respondents categorised themselves in BSG defined moderate or high-risk groups, requiring stringent social distancing or shielding. 87% did not change their IBD medication, with most reported changes initiated by the IBD team. 39% were worried about their IBD care, but most services were largely uninterrupted. 90% received 'at-risk' notification often from multiple sources, but 17% not until May. The majority reported a negative impact of COVID-19 on their quality of life and significantly increased perceived stress. Patients expressed a strong wish of having future care delivered remotely. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has had a significant negative impact on psychological well-being of patients with IBD. Local IBD services must have a robust data set of vulnerable patients and be designated future responsibility for prompt communication of advice to avoid delayed and sometimes conflicting information. Remote patient management systems should be further developed and embedded in clinical practice.",,"Harris, Richard James; Downey, Louise; Smith, Trevor R; Cummings, J R Fraser; Felwick, Richard; Gwiggner, Markus",Unknown,,227072875.0,,256
2dy52qyq,Medline; PMC; WHO,"Coronavirus: occurrence, surveillance, and persistence in wastewater",10.1007/s10661-021-09303-8,no-cc,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak reported in China in December 2019 has spread throughout the world. The WHO declared it as a pandemic in March 2020. The pandemic severely affected public health and the global economy. Many studies conducted on the coronavirus have helped us to elucidate its pathogenicity and pathophysiology. However, it is important to study the behavior of the pathogen in the environment to develop effective control measures. While studying the persistence and transmission of viruses in drinking water and wastewater systems, a low concentration of coronavirus and its nucleic acids have been detected in municipal wastewaters. This could be due to their high susceptibilities to degradation in aqueous environments. Epidemiological study on coronaviruses in wastewater will serve two purposes, i.e., in early detection of outbreak and in identifying asymptomatic carriers. In such cases, the epidemiological study will help in early detection of the presence of the virus in the community. Secondly, it will help in knowing if there are asymptomatic carriers, as such people do not show any signs of symptoms but shed the viruses in feces. The present review focuses on the epidemiological surveillance of wastewater for coronaviruses, as in recent years these are increasingly causing global pandemics. In this review we have discussed, the four pertinent areas of coronavirus study: (1) occurrence of coronavirus in wastewater, (2) wastewater based epidemiological surveillance of coronaviruses, (3) epidemiological surveillance tools used for detection of coronaviruses in sewage, and (4) persistence and sustainability of coronaviruses in wastewater.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of LVRC treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS This was a retrospective analysis of 86 patients (male/female: 40/46, mean age: 64±7 years) with severe COPD and bilateral incomplete fissures. A total of 10 coils were unilaterally implanted in a single lobe, and 28 out of 86 patients were treated bilaterally. At 90-, 180-, and 365-day follow-up, changes in pulmonary function test (PFT), 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale, as well as possible complications, were recorded. RESULTS At 90 days, the forced expiratory volume in 1 second did improve (P<0.001), but the improvement was not sustained at the 180- and 365-day follow-up (baseline: 0.71±0.21 vs 0.77±0.23 vs 0.73±0.22 vs 0.70±0.18 L). Both vital capacity and residual volume improved significantly (P<0.001) at the 90- and 180-day follow-up, but the improvement was lost after 365 days. Total lung capacity decreased at the 90-day follow-up but returned to baseline values at the 180- and 365-day follow-up. 6MWT (P=0.01) and mMRC (P=0.007) also improved at 90 and 180 days (Δ6MWT of 31±54 and 20±60 m, respectively), but the improvement was also lost at the 365-day follow-up. No significant further improvement was evident at any point in the follow-up after the second procedure. A total of 4 out of 86 patients passed away due to complications. Significant complications in the first 3 months and then at 12 months included the following: severe hemoptysis in 4 (3.5%) and 4 (3.5%) patients, pneumonia requiring hospitalization in 32 (28.1%) and 9 (7.9%) patients and pneumothorax in 7 (6.1%) and 2 (1.7%) patients, respectively. Milder adverse events included self-limited hemoptysis, pneumonias, or COPD exacerbations treated orally.

When transmission-based PPE ensembles are not appropriate, HCP must recognize the transmission pathway of the disease and anticipate the exposures to select PPE. Because guidance for this process is extremely limited, we proposed a systematic, risk-based approach to the selection and evaluation of PPE ensembles to protect HCP against infectious diseases. METHODS: The approach used in this study included the following 4 steps: (1) job hazard analysis, (2) infectious disease hazard analysis, (3) selection of PPE, and (4) evaluation of selected PPE. Selected PPE should protect HCP from exposure, be usable by HCP, and fit for purpose. RESULTS: The approach was demonstrated for the activity of intubation of a patient with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus. As expected, the approach led to the selection of different ensembles of PPE for these 2 pathogens. DISCUSSION: A systematic risk-based approach to the selection of PPE will help health care facilities and HCP select PPE when transmission-based precautions are not appropriate. Owing to the complexity of PPE ensemble selection and evaluation, a team with expertise in infectious diseases, occupational health, the health care activity, and related disciplines, such as human factors, should be engaged.

Taking this into account, in the present work, we have analysed a Bats–Hosts–Reservoir–People transmission fractional-order COVID-19 model for simulating the potential transmission with the thought of individual response and control measures by the government. The real data available about number of infected cases from 14 March, 2000 to 26 March, 2020 is analysed and, accordingly, various parameters of the model are estimated or fitted. The Picard successive approximation technique and Banach’s fixed point theory have been used for verification of the existence and stability criteria of the model. Further, we conduct stability analysis for both disease-free and endemic equilibrium states. On the basis of sensitivity analysis and dynamics of the threshold parameter, we estimate the effectiveness of preventive measures, predicting future outbreaks and potential control strategies of the disease using the proposed model. Numerical computations are carried out utilising the iterative Laplace transform method and comparative study of different fractional differential operators is done. The impacts of various biological parameters on transmission dynamics of COVID-19 is investigated.

METHODS: We included critically ill patients, performed GM-EIA and GM-LFA in TA and followed them until development of CAPA or alternate diagnosis. CAPA was defined according to the modified AspICU criteria in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We estimated sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for GM-EIA, GM-LFA, the combination of both or either positive results for GM-EIA and GM-LFA. We explored accuracy using different breakpoints, through ROC analysis and Youden index to identify the optimal cutoffs. We described antifungal treatment and 30-day mortality. RESULTS: We identified 14/144 (9.7%) patients with CAPA, mean age was 50.35 (SD 11.9), the median time from admission to CAPA was eight days; 28.5% received tocilizumab and 30-day mortality was 57%. ROC analysis and Youden index identified 2.0 OD as the best cut-off, resulting in sensitivity and specificity of 57.1% and 81.5% for GM-EIA and 60% and 72.6% for GM-LFA, respectively.

zskn8ak1,WHO,ACE2: from protection of liver disease to propagation of COVID-19,,unk,"Twenty years ago, the discovery of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was an important breakthrough dramatically enhancing our understanding of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). The classical RAS is driven by its key enzyme ACE and is pivotal in the regulation of blood pressure and fluid homeostasis. More recently, it has been recognised that the protective RAS regulated by ACE2 counterbalances many of the deleterious effects of the classical RAS. Studies in murine models demonstrated that manipulating the protective RAS can dramatically alter many diseases including liver disease. Liver-specific overexpression of ACE2 in mice with liver fibrosis has proved to be highly effective in antagonising liver injury and fibrosis progression. Importantly, despite its highly protective role in disease pathogenesis, ACE2 is hijacked by SARS-CoV-2 as a cellular receptor to gain entry to alveolar epithelial cells, causing COVID-19, a severe respiratory disease in humans. COVID-19 is frequently life-threatening especially in elderly or people with other medical conditions. As an unprecedented number of COVID-19 patients have been affected globally, there is an urgent need to discover novel therapeutics targeting the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and ACE2. Understanding the role of ACE2 in physiology, pathobiology and as a cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection provides insight into potential new therapeutic strategies aiming to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection related tissue injury. This review outlines the role of the RAS with a strong focus on ACE2-driven protective RAS in liver disease and provides therapeutic approaches to develop strategies to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.",,"Warner, Fiona J; Rajapaksha, Harinda; Shackel, Nicholas; Herath, Chandana B",Clin Sci (Lond),,227947702.0,,247

We aimed to evaluate the relevance of two municipality-level deprivation indices (DIs), the French-Deprivation-Index (FDep) and the French-European-Deprivation-Index (FEDI) in perinatal health through two key perinatal outcomes: preterm birth (PTB) and small-for-gestational-age (SGA). METHODS: We used two data sources: The French National Perinatal Surveys (NPS) and the French national health data system (SNDS). Using the former, we compared the gradients of the associations between individual socioeconomic characteristics (educational level and income) and “PTB and SGA” and associations between municipality-level DIs (Q1:least deprived; Q5:most deprived) and “PTB and SGA”. Using the SNDS, we then studied the association between each component of the two DIs (census data, 2015) and “PTB and SGA”. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) were estimated using multilevel logistic regression with random intercept at the municipality level. RESULTS: In the NPS (N = 26,238), PTB and SGA were associated with two individual socioeconomic characteristics: maternal educational level (≤ lower secondary school vs. ≥ Bachelor’s degree or equivalent, PTB: aOR = 1.43 [1.22–1.68], SGA: (1.31 [1.61–1.49]) and household income (< 1000 € vs. ≥ 3000 €, PTB: 1.55 [1.25–1.92], SGA: 1.69 [1.45–1.98]). For both FDep and FEDI, PTB and SGA were more frequent in deprived municipalities (Q5: 7.8% vs. Q1: 6.3% and 9.0% vs. 5.9% for PTB, respectively, and 12.0% vs. 10.3% and 11.9% vs. 10.2% for SGA, respectively). However, after adjustment, neither FDep nor FEDI showed a significant gradient with PTB or SGA. In the SNDS (N = 726,497), no FDep component, and only three FEDI components were significantly associated (specifically, the % of the population with ≤ lower secondary level of education with both outcomes (PTB: 1.5 [1.15–1.96]); SGA: 1.25 [1.03–1.51]), the % of overcrowded (i.e., > 1 person per room) houses (1.63 [1.15–2.32]) with PTB only, and unskilled farm workers with SGA only (1.52 [1.29–1.79]). CONCLUSION: Some components of FDep and FEDI were less relevant than others for capturing ecological inequalities in PTB and SGA. Results varied for each DI and perinatal outcome studied. These findings highlight the importance of testing DI relevance prior to examining perinatal health inequalities, and suggest the need to develop DIs that are suitable for pregnant women.

PATIENT CONCERNS: In this report, we present the clinical data of 5 critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted, between January 16 and February 26, 2020, in intensive care unit of Xiaogan Central Hospital. DIAGNOSIS AND INTERVENTIONS: All these patients had a persistently positive nucleic acid test and received CPT. All 5 patients had severe respiratory failure, and thus, required invasive mechanical ventilation. The median time from the onset of symptoms to initiating the CPT was 37 (Interquartile range, 34-44) days. OUTCOMES: Only 2 patients were cured and subsequently discharged, while 3 patients succumbed due to multiple organ failure. CONCLUSION: The time of initiating the CPT may be an important factor affecting its efficacy, and its therapeutic effect in the treatment of COVID-19, in the late stage, is limited.",,"Wang, Min; Yang, Xiaohong; Yang, Fang; Zhu, Xinxin; Sun, Zhibing; Bao, Peiling; Yan, Yimin",Medicine (Baltimore),,221572795.0,,181

The aim of this work is to evaluate the importance of aerosol transmission routes and the effectiveness of the 2-metre separation distance policy. A potential impact of use of face masks on the infection transmission rate, and an opportunity to reduce infection in hospitals, care homes and other public spaces by appropriate monitoring and filtering of air are also considered. The results obtained demonstrate that aerosol particles generated by coughing and sneezing can travel over 30 m. Modelling of the evolution of aerosol clouds generated by coughing and sneezing enables us to evaluate the deposition dose of aerosol particles in healthy individuals. For example, a person in a public place (e.g. supermarket or car park) can accumulate in the respiratory system up to 200 virus copies in 2 min time by breathing in virus laden aerosols. Wearing face mask considerably reduces the deposited load down to 2 virus copies per 2 min. The modelling also suggests that it should be possible to measure virus causing COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) within aerosol particles in hospitals and public places, e.g. care homes and supermarkets.",,"Gorbunov, Boris",Unknown,https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202004.0546.v2,219454413.0,,204

ytb4nr50,WHO,Assessing regional risk of COVID-19 infection from Wuhan via high-speed rail,,unk,"This paper demonstrates that transportation networks may be used to assess and predict the regional risk of COVID-19 infection from the outbreak. We use China's high-speed rail (HSR) network at the scale of prefecture level to assess, based on a probabilistic risk model, the risk of COVID-19 infection from Wuhan to the country's 31 province-level regions at the early stage of domestic spread. We find that the high-risk regions are mainly distributed along the southern half of Beijing-Hong Kong HSR line, where a large number of infection cases have been confirmed at the early stage. Furthermore, the two components of the infection risk, namely, the probability (proxied by the region's correlation with Wuhan through HSR) and the impact (proxied by the region's population with mobility), can play different roles in the risk ranking for different regions. For public health administrators, these findings may be used for better decision making, including the preparation of emergency plans and supplies, and the allocation of limited resources, before the extensive spread of the epidemic. Moreover, the administrators should adopt different intervention measures for different regions, so as to better mitigate the epidemic spread according to their own risk scenarios with respect to the probability of occurring and, once occurred, the impact.",,"Li, Tao; Rong, Lili; Zhang, Anming",Unknown,,233224272.0,,207

We aimed to describe clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with cancer and COVID-19, and examined risk factors for mortality in this population. METHODS: We did a retrospective, multicentre, cohort study of 205 patients with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and with a pathological diagnosis of a malignant tumour in nine hospitals within Hubei, China, from Jan 13 to March 18, 2020. All patients were either discharged from hospitals or had died by April 20, 2020. Clinical characteristics, laboratory data, and cancer histories were compared between survivors and non-survivors by use of &#967;2 test. Risk factors for mortality were identified by univariable and multivariable logistic regression models. FINDINGS: Between Jan 13 and Mar 18, 2020, 205 patients with cancer and laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled (median age 63 years [IQR 56-70; range 14-96]; 109 [53%] women). 183 (89%) had solid tumours and 22 (11%) had haematological malignancies. The median duration of follow-up was 68 days (IQR 59-78). The most common solid tumour types were breast (40 [20%] patients), colorectal (28 [14%]), and lung cancer (24 [12%]). 54 (30%) of 182 patients received antitumour therapies within 4 weeks before symptom onset. 30 (15%) of 205 patients were transferred to an intensive care unit and 40 (20%) died during hospital admission. Patients with haematological malignancies had poorer prognoses than did those with solid tumours: nine (41%) of 22 patients with haematological malignancies died versus 31 (17%) of 183 patients with solid tumours (hazard ratio for death 3·28 [95% CI 1·56-6·91]; log rank p=0·0009). Multivariable regression analysis showed that receiving chemotherapy within 4 weeks before symptom onset (odds ratio [OR] 3·51 [95% CI 1·16-10·59]; p=0·026) and male sex (OR 3·86 [95% CI 1·57-9·50]; p=0·0033) were risk factors for death during admission to hospital. INTERPRETATION: Patients with cancer and COVID-19 who were admitted to hospital had a high case-fatality rate. Unfavourable prognostic factors, including receiving chemotherapy within 4 weeks before symptom onset and male sex, might help clinicians to identify patients at high risk of fatal outcomes.

The purpose of our study was to assess a novel stem with an embedded sensor that can remotely and objectively monitor a patient's mobility after TKA. METHODS: A single anatomically designed knee system was implanted in concert with an interconnected tibial stem extension containing 3D accelerometers, 3D gyroscopes, a power source, and a telemetry transmission capability in 3 cadaveric pelvis to toe specimens. The legs were moved by hand to preset tibial positions at full knee extension, midflexion, flexion, and back to midflexion and extension for a total of 16 trials across 6 knees. RESULTS: Sensor data were successfully transmitted with good quality of signal to an external base station. Good correlation to the range of motion of the tibia was found (mean error 0.1 degrees; root mean square error 3.8 degrees). The signal from the heel drop tests suggests the sensor could detect heel strike during activities of daily living in vivo and the potential for additional signal processing to analyze vibratory and motion patterns detected by the sensors. A frequency domain analysis of a properly cemented and poorly cemented implant during the heel drop test suggests a difference in accelerometer signal in these implant states.

We have previously shown the feasibility of IGF-1R imaging using the Affibody molecule (111)In-DOTA-His(6)-Z(IGF1R:4551). The use of (99m)Tc instead of (111)In should improve sensitivity and resolution of imaging, and reduce the dose burden to patients. We hypothesized that inclusion of a HEHEHE tag instead of a His(6) tag in Z(IGF1R:4551) would permit its convenient purification using IMAC, enable labelling with [(99m)Tc(CO)(3)](+), and improve its biodistribution. METHODS Z(IGF1R:4551) was expressed with a HEHEHE tag in the N terminus. The resulting (HE)(3)-Z(IGF1R:4551) construct was labelled with [(99m)Tc(CO)(3)](+). Targeting of IGF-1R-expressing cells using [(99m)Tc(CO)(3)](+)-(HE)(3)-Z(IGF1R:4551) was evaluated in vitro and in vivo.

Infected patients may then develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cardiovascular (CV) complications. The omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and its bioactive metabolites favorably modulate inflammation and EC function. These benefits of EPA may contribute to reduced CV events as reported in outcome trials (REDUCE-IT). Currently, EPA is being tested in patients with or at risk for COVID-19. This study tested the effects of either EPA pre- or post-treatment on global protein expression in human pulmonary ECs under conditions of inflammation using the cytokine IL-6 to simulate conditions of advanced viral infections. METHODS: Human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-L) were pre-treated with either EPA (40 μM) or IL-6 (12 ng/mL) for 2 hr and then treated with IL-6 or EPA, respectively, for 24 hr in media with 2% FBS. Proteomic analysis was performed using LC/MS to assess relative protein expression levels. Only significant (p< 0.05) changes in protein expression between treatment groups >1-fold were analyzed. Expression of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) was separately measured with immunochemistry. RESULTS: HMVEC-L pre- and post-treated with EPA during challenge with IL-6 showed significant changes in 100 (49/51 up/down) and 441 (229/212 up/down) proteins, respectively, compared with IL-6 treatment alone. Among the 31 proteins that were significantly modulated by both EPA pre- and post-treatment, thioredoxin reductase 1 increased relative to IL-6 alone, while matrix metalloproteinase 1 and fibronectin both decreased. Other proteins, such as hypoxia up-regulated protein 1, were differentially modulated by EPA relative to IL-6 (increased in pre-treatment, decreased in post-treatment). Finally, EPA significantly reduced sICAM- 1expression by 41% and 12% compared with IL-6 alone in the pre- and post-treatment models, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that EPA favorably modulates the expression of multiple inflammatory and cytoprotective proteins during inflammation.

uqbuo7ib,PMC,Assessment of vascular endothelial function in COVID-19 patients,10.1093/eurheartj/ehab724.2017,no-cc,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor as a means to enter the host. High density of ACE2 receptor in vascular endothelial cells may explain why vascular complications related to endothelial dysfunction occur in COVID-19. However, in vivo assessment of vascular endothelial function during COVID-19 has not been reported. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the vascular endothelial function and its temporal changes in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In this prospective blinded study, systemic endothelial function was assessed using plethysmography-derived peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT). The reactive hyperemia index (LnRHI), a measure of endothelium-mediated hyperaemia, and the augmentation index, a measure of arterial vascular stiffness, were measured in 102 individuals across three study groups using PAT: group 1 (active infection), constituted by 20 patients hospitalised due to acute COVID-19; group 2 (past infection), constituted by 52 patients who had recovered from COVID-19; and group 3 (controls), constituted by 30 healthcare workers not infected by SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, among group 1, PAT assessment was repeated in 14 patients several weeks after recovery from acute COVID-19. PAT studies were analysed at a blinded fashion with respect to the assigned study group. RESULTS: Lower resting PAT amplitude was found in acute COVID-19 patients compared to the other groups (ratio of arterial tone signal between hyperemia to resting condition was 1.5 [interquartile range, 1.1] in group 1, 1.3 [0.3] in group 2 and 1.2 [0.3] in group 3, p=0.041). On the contrary, no significant differences between groups were found with respect to the hyperemic PAT amplitude (867.9 [486.1] in group 1, 944.7 [748.1] in group 2 and 819.3 [639.6] in group 3, p=0.444). Due to the lower resting PAT amplitude, there was a paradoxically significantly increased LnRHI during acute COVID-19 compared to past infection and controls (0.73 [0.32] vs. 0.53 [0.31] vs. 0.44 [0.23], respectively; p=0.013) (Figure A). Furthermore, among group 1 patients, LnRHI normalised markedly from acute COVID-19 to past infection stage (0.73 [0.32] vs. 0.49 [0.28], respectively; p=0.005) (Figure B). Augmentation index was significantly higher during acute COVID-19 compared to past COVID-19 and controls (9.6 [19.1] in group 1, 6.97 [18.6] in group 2 and −0.35 [20.53] in group 3; p=0.045 for COVID groups vs. controls). CONCLUSIONS: Non-invasive assessment of systemic vascular endothelial function with PAT revealed significant differences between subjects with acute COVID-19, past COVID-19 and controls. Lower baseline PAT amplitude and high augmentation index suggest vasoconstriction at rest during the acute phase of COVID-19. These findings open new research opportunities to investigate the prognostic value of PAT in COVID-19 patients.

Over past few years, non-invasive respiratory support is getting more popular across pediatric intensive care units for acute respiratory failure as well as for long-term ventilation support at home. It reduces the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, decreases the risk of nosocomial pneumonia as well as mortality in selected pediatric and adult population. Unfortunately, majority of available studies on non-invasive respiratory support have been conducted in high-income countries, which are different from low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) in terms of resources, manpower, and the disease profile. Hence, we need to consider disease profile, severity at hospital presentation, availability of age-appropriate equipment, ability of healthcare professionals to manage patients on non-invasive respiratory support, and cost-benefit ratio. In view of the relatively high cost of equipment, there is a need to innovate to develop indigenous kits/devices with available resources in LMICs to reduce the cost and potentially benefit health system. In this review, we highlight the role of non-invasive respiratory support in different clinical conditions, practical problems encountered in LMICs setting, and few indigenous techniques to provide non-invasive respiratory support.",2021-05-03,"Gulla, Krishna Mohan; Kabra, Sushil Kumar; Lodha, Rakesh",Indian Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33941707/,233722084.0,2021.0,210

Objective: We aim to compare the severity and mortality between male and female patients with both COVID-19 and SARS, to explore the most useful prognostic factors for individualized assessment. Design, Setting, and Participants: We extracted the data from a case series of 43 hospitalized patients we treated, a public data set of the first 37 cases died of COVID-19 in Wuhan city and 1019 survived patients from six cities in China. We also analyzed the data of 524 patients with SARS, including 139 deaths, from Beijing city in early 2003. Main Outcomes and Measures: Severity and mortality. Results: Older age and high number of comorbidities were associated with higher severity and mortality in patients with both COVID-19 and SARS. The percentages of older age (≥65 years) were much higher in the deceased group than in the survived group in patients with both COVID-19 (83.8 vs. 13.2, P<0.001) and SARS (37.4 vs. 4.9, P<0.001). In the case series, men tend to be more serious than women (P=0.035), although age was comparable between men and women. In the public data set, age was also comparable between men and women in the deceased group or the survived group in patients with COVID-19. Meanwhile, gender distribution was exactly symmetrical in the 1019 survivors of COVID-19. However, the percentage of male were higher in the deceased group than in the survived group (70.3 vs. 50.0, P=0.015). The gender role in mortality was also observed in SARS patients. Survival analysis showed that men (hazard ratio [95% CI] 1.47 [1.05-2.06, P= 0.025) had a significantly higher mortality rate than women in patients with SARS. Conclusions and Relevance: Older age and male gender are risk factors for worse outcome in patients with COVID.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used at total of 262 serum samples (197 pre-pandemic and 65 convalescent COVID-19), and three criteria to evaluate the rapid tests under standardized and optimal conditions: (i) Immunoglobulin G (IgG) specificity ""good"" if lower limit of the 95% confidence interval was &#8805; 97.0%, ""acceptable"" if point estimate was &#8805; 97.0%, otherwise ""not acceptable"". (ii) IgG sensitivity ""good"" if point estimate was &#8805; 90.0%, ""acceptable"" if &#8805; 85.0%, otherwise ""not acceptable"". (iii) User-friendliness ""not acceptable"" if complicated to perform or difficult to read result, otherwise ""good"". We also included partial evaluations of three automated immunoassay systems. RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity varied considerably; IgG specificity between 90.9% (85.9-94.2) and 100% (97.7-100.0), and IgG sensitivity between 53.8% (41.9-65.4) and 98.5% (91.0-100.0). Combining our evaluation criteria, none of the 28 rapid tests that detected IgG had an overall performance considered ""good"", seven tests were considered ""acceptable"", while 21 tests were considered ""not acceptable"". Four tests detected only total antibodies and were not given an overall evaluation. IgG sensitivity and/or specificity of the automated immunoassays did not exceed that of many rapid tests.

The aim of this paper is to describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hip and knee arthroplasties in an Italian high-volume orthopedic center, located in the region of the country first and worst affected by the Coronavirus. METHODS: Data from an institutional database were retrospectively analyzed to obtain the number of hip and knee arthroplasties performed from February 24 to April 10 2020. The figures were compared with those of the same 7-week period of the last year (2019). RESULTS: The number of hip and knee arthroplasties showed a decrease from 706 in the same period of 2019 to 166 (76.5% less) in the current year. In 2019, a mean of 101 ± 9 hip and knee arthroplasties were performed per week compared with a mean of 24 ± 34 in 2020. Ten patients tested positive for SARS-CoV2 during their hospital stay. Two of these patients died after a regular postoperative period after developing unexpectedly COVID-19 during rehabilitation. The mortality in the 7-week period of the current year was 1.2% compared with 0% in 2019. CONCLUSION: The outbreak of COVID-19 had a considerable effect in our center on the number of hip and knee arthroplasties that rapidly decreased to 0 in parallel to the worsening of the situation in the country.

qcngigjm,ArXiv,A Transformer-based Math Language Model for Handwritten Math Expression Recognition,,arxiv,"Handwritten mathematical expressions (HMEs) contain ambiguities in their interpretations, even for humans sometimes. Several math symbols are very similar in the writing style, such as dot and comma or 0, O, and o, which is a challenge for HME recognition systems to handle without using contextual information. To address this problem, this paper presents a Transformer-based Math Language Model (TMLM). Based on the self-attention mechanism, the high-level representation of an input token in a sequence of tokens is computed by how it is related to the previous tokens. Thus, TMLM can capture long dependencies and correlations among symbols and relations in a mathematical expression (ME). We trained the proposed language model using a corpus of approximately 70,000 LaTeX sequences provided in CROHME 2016. TMLM achieved the perplexity of 4.42, which outperformed the previous math language models, i.e., the N-gram and recurrent neural network-based language models. In addition, we combine TMLM into a stochastic context-free grammar-based HME recognition system using a weighting parameter to re-rank the top-10 best candidates. The expression rates on the testing sets of CROHME 2016 and CROHME 2019 were improved by 2.97 and 0.83 percentage points, respectively.",2021-08-11,"Ung, Huy Quang; Nguyen, Cuong Tuan; Nguyen, Hung Tuan; Truong, Thanh-Nghia; Nakagawa, Masaki",Unknown,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.05002v1.pdf,236976240.0,2021.0,190

Focusing on COVID-19-attributable mortality in the United States (U.S.), we quantified and contrasted years of potential life lost (YPLL) attributable to COVID-19 by sex based on data from the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics as of 31 March 2021, specifically by contrasting male and female percentages of total YPLL with their respective percent population shares and calculating age-adjusted male-to-female YPLL rate ratios, both nationally and for each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Using YPLL before age 75 to anchor comparisons between males and females and a novel Monte Carlo simulation procedure to perform estimation and uncertainty quantification, our results reveal a near-universal pattern across states of higher COVID-19-attributable YPLL among males compared to females. Furthermore, the disproportionately high COVID-19 mortality burden among males is generally more pronounced when measuring mortality burden in terms of YPLL compared to death counts, reflecting dual phenomena of males dying from COVID-19 at higher rates and at systematically younger ages relative to females. The U.S. COVID-19 epidemic also offers lessons underscoring the importance of cultivating a public health environment that recognizes sex-specific needs as well as different patterns in risk factors, health behaviors, and responses to interventions between men and women.

Drawing from Lacanian psychoanalysis and Ernesto Laclau’s theory, the pandemic is conceptualised as an ‘imaginary dislocation’. This analytical device is deployed to examine the author’s scenes of reading and writing during the first year of his PhD in the UK. By conceptualising the pandemic as an imaginary dislocation, the interpretation focuses on the unconscious content repressed in both scenes as an indicator of the struggles to endure in his academic identity vis-à-vis the erosion of his imaginary of the university. In order to capture this messy, elusive content, the interpretation relies on the idea of the tremor. Emerging incessantly in the author’s readings during the pandemic, the tremor is explored here as a trope staging, in unison, unconscious encounters, a trait of the author’s identity and a metaphor of the pandemic. Therefore, by both advancing a conceptual proposal and interpreting an empirical case, the article seeks to contribute to the understanding of how the pandemic has affected the imaginary frameworks within which our symbolic identifications find stability. © Policy Press 2021.",,"Sánchez, G.",Journal of Psychosocial Studies,https://doi.org/10.1332/147867321x16291285624483,244322132.0,,190

wo4q7hfi,WHO,Short-term air pollution exposure and COVID-19 infection in the United States☆,,unk,"The Sars-CoV-2 disease (known as COVID-19) has become a global public health emergency. Researchers have been unveiling the transmission mechanisms and disclosing possible contributing factors. Studies have theorized plausible linkage mechanisms between air pollution exposure and COVID-19 infection and have divided the air pollution exposure into two types: long-term exposure and short-term exposure. However, present studies on impacts of short-term exposure have not reached a conclusive result and are mostly focusing on Asian and European countries. In this study, we conduct a nationwide analysis to examine the association between short-term air pollution exposure and COVID-19 infection in the United States. Daily confirmed cases, air pollution information, and meteorological factors at the county level were collected between March 1st and June 30th, 2020. A total of 806 (out of 3143) counties were included in this study, with 554 counties for PM2.5, 670 counties for ozone (O3), and 418 counties for both, accounting for around 2.1 million cumulative confirmed cases. This accounts for about 80% of all confirmed cases in the U.S. over the study period.

This provided a unique situation to investigate the effect of training limitations on the training patterns, training adaptive strategies and mental health of BoFAs. OBJECTIVES: The primary aim of this study was to investigate differences in the training patterns and the mental health of BoFA before and during the first COVID-19 lockdown. The secondary aim was to assess whether BoFA who exhibited features of muscle dysmorphia were affected differently from the group that did not. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 85 BoFAs by means of an online questionnaire asking about sports activity, intensity, subjective physical performance, and economic status, including primary or secondary occupations before (from memory) and during lockdown, current physical health problems and financial fears, symptoms of depression, sleep disorders, anxiety (trait and state), muscle dysmorphia, coping mechanisms and actions during the first lockdown in Switzerland. RESULTS: Training patterns and mental health of BoFA were influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic and first lockdown. During lockdown, the physical activity on the BoFA dropped significantly from 2.3 ± 0.8 h per day to 1.6 ± 0.9 h per day (p < 0.001), the subjective training intensity decreased significantly from 85.7 ± 13.2% to 58.3 ± 28.3% (p < 0.001) and the subjective performance declined significantly from 83.4 ± 14.3% to 58.2 ± 27.8% (p < 0.001) of maximal performance. In comparison to those without risk for body dysmorphia, participants at risk rated their maximal performance significantly lower and scored significantly higher for depression, sleep disorders and anxiety. CONCLUSION: This study showed the significant changes on the training patterns of BoFA before and during the first COVID-19 lockdown and poor mental health scores of BoFA during the lockdown itself, with those at risk of muscle dysmorphia scoring statistically worse regarding mental health than those with no risk of muscle dysmorphia. To better understand the particularities of BoFA, further investigation is needed to understand their psychology and in particular the effect of training restrictions on it.",2022-05-03,"Iff, Samuel; Fröhlich, Stefan; Halioua, Robin; Imboden, Christian; Spörri, Jörg; Scherr, Johannes; Butzke, Ingo; Seifritz, Erich; Claussen, Malte Christian",Front Sports Act Living,https://doi.org/10.3389/fspor.2022.867140; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35592589/,248498206.0,2022.0,360

As safety data continues to evolve, healthcare providers are considered important sources for product use, yet little is known about provider knowledge or self-efficacy to counsel patient about novel tobacco product use. This cross-sectional study used data from a Japanese Association of Smoking Control Science (JASCS) online survey of physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and public health practitioners (N = 277) to assess provider knowledge of novel tobacco products and self-efficacy to counsel patients about product use. Correlates of knowledge and self-efficacy were also assessed. More than half the sample had received previous training in treating tobacco use, but 62% of respondents had no knowledge of HTPs; 80% of respondents indicated that they occasionally or always provide smoking cessation support. Overall knowledge of HTPs was low (41.4% correct) with higher knowledge for HTPs containing nicotine (89% correct) vs. HTPs emitting no carbon monoxide (25%). Self-efficacy to counsel patients about novel tobacco products was low on a scale ranging from 10 to 70 (Mean = 31.2; Standard Deviation = 16.7). Greater knowledge of HTPs was associated with male gender, higher rates of training at JASCS and previous learning about HTPs at JASCS. (p < 0.05).

The purpose of the IHR is to prevent, protect against, control – and provide a public health response to – international spread of disease. The territory of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and that of several other Member States, such as China, Denmark, France, the Netherlands and the United States of America, include overseas territories, which cover a total population of approximately 15 million people. Member States have a responsibility to ensure that all parts of their territory comply with the IHR. Since WHO has not provided specific guidance on compliance in the special circumstances of the overseas territories of Member States, compliance by these territories is an issue for self-assessment by Member States themselves. To date, no reports have been published on the assessment of IHR compliance in countries with overseas territories. We describe a gap analysis done in the United Kingdom to assess IHR compliance of its overseas territories.

Methods We have functionally characterized the anti-SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune immunoglobulin (hIG) prepared from human COVID-19 convalescent plasma. SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization was evaluated by four different methodologies (plaque reduction, virus induced cytotoxicity, TCID50 reduction and immunofluorimetry-based methodology) performed at four different laboratories and using four geographically different SARS-CoV-2 isolates (one each from USA and Italy; two from Spain). Two of the isolates contained the D614G mutation. Neutralization capacity against the original Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 straom and variants (D614G mutant, B.1.1.7, P.1 and B.1.351 variants) was evaluated using a pseudovirus platform expressing the corresponding spike (S) protein. The capacity to induce antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) was also evaluated. Results All the SARS-CoV-2 isolates tested were effectively neutralized by hIG solutions. This was confirmed by all four methodologies showing potent neutralization capacity. Wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and variants were effectively neutralized as demonstrated using the pseudovirus platform. The hIG solutions had the capacity to induce ADCC and ADCP against SARS-CoV-2 N and S proteins but not the E protein. Under our experimental conditions, very low concentrations (25-100 µg IgG/mL) were required to induce both effects. Besides the S protein, we observed a clear and potent effect triggered by antibodies in the hIG solutions against the SARS-CoV-2 N protein. Conclusions These results show that, beyond neutralization, other IgG Fc-dependent pathways may play a role in the protection from and/or resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection when using hIG COVID-19 products. This could be especially relevant for the treatment of more neutralization resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.",2021-06-11,"Díez, José María; Romero, Carolina; Cruz, María; Vandeberg, Peter; Merritt, W.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 7799 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the hospitals of Kermanshah province. Data gathered from February 18 to July 9, 2020, were obtained from the vice-chancellor for the health of Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences. The performance of the models was compared according to the sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS: According to the decision tree model, the most important risk factors for death due to COVID-19 were age, body temperature, admission to intensive care unit (ICU), prior hospital visit within the last 14 days, and cardiovascular disease. Also, the multivariate logistic regression model showed that the variables of age [OR = 4.47, 95% CI: (3.16 -6.32)], shortness of breath [OR = 1.42, 95% CI: (1.0-2.01)], ICU admission [OR = 3.75, 95% CI: (2.47-5.68)], abnormal chest X-ray [OR = 1.93, 95% CI: (1.06-3.41)], liver disease [OR = 5.05, 95% CI (1.020-25.2)], body temperature [OR = 4.93, 95% CI: (2.17-6.25)], and cardiovascular disease [OR = 2.15, 95% CI: (1.27-3.06)] were significantly associated with the higher mortality of patients with COVID-19. The area under the ROC curve for the decision tree model and logistic regression was 0.77 and 0.75, respectively.

METHODS.: Anonymized data from the regional psychiatric care register have been obtained and analyzed. The seven GHPWs care for approximately 1.4 million inhabitants and have a total of 119 beds. RESULTS.: In the 40-day period (February 21-March 31, 2020) after the start of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, compared to a similar 40-day period prior to February 21, and compared to two 40-day periods of 2019, there has been a marked reduction in psychiatric admission rates. The reduction was explained by voluntary admissions, while there was not a noticeable reduction for involuntary admissions. The reduction was visible for all diagnostic groups, except for a group of 'Other' diagnoses, which includes anxiety disorders, neurocognitive disorders, etc. CONCLUSIONS.: Large-scale pandemics can modify voluntary admission rates to psychiatric facilities in the early phases following pandemic onset. We suggest that the reduction in admission rates may be due to fear of hospitals, seen as possible sites of contagion, as well as to a change in thresholds of behavioral problems acting as a trigger for admission requests from family relatives or referrals from treating clinicians. It is unclear from the study whether the reduction in admissions was contributed to most by the current pandemic or the lockdown imposed due to the pandemic.",,"Clerici, M; Durbano, F; Spinogatti, F; Vita, A; de Girolamo, G; Micciolo, R",Ir J Psychol Med,,218505316.0,,245

Objectives: To assess the relationship between breakfast habits and fluid intake with the hydration status and learning concentration of adolescents in learning online during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: This was a cohort study. The study population comprised 146 adolescents in a Junior High School, located in Surabaya, chosen using proportional random sampling and simple random sampling techniques. The research instruments were questionnaires, 24 hour food recall surveys, urine colour surveys, and grid concentration tests. The independent variables in this study were breakfast habits and fluid intake, while dependent variables were hydration status and concentration. Data analysis used descriptive analysis and Spearman correlation with α=0.05. Results: When participating in online learning during Covid-19 pandemic, most adolescents had good breakfast habits, adequate fluid intake, good hydration status and good learning concentration levels. Breakfast habits had a positive relationship with learning concentration (p=&lt;0.001;r=0.316), while fluid intake had a very strong relationship with hydration status (p=&lt;0.001;r=0.952) and learning concentration (p=&lt;0.001;r=560).

Within the I-MOVE-COVID-19 primary care multicentre study, we measured the association between 2019–20 influenza vaccination and COVID-19. Methods We conducted a multicentre test-negative case-control study at primary care level, in study sites in five European countries, from March–August 2020. Patients presenting with acute respiratory infection were swabbed, with demographic, 2019–20 influenza vaccination and clinical information documented. Using logistic regression we measured the adjusted odds ratio (aOR), adjusting for study site and age, sex, calendar time, presence of chronic conditions. The main analysis included patients swabbed ≤7 days after onset from the three countries with <15% of missing influenza vaccination. In secondary analyses, we included five countries, using multiple imputation with chained equations to account for missing data. Results We included 257 COVID-19 cases and 1631 controls in the main analysis (three countries). The overall aOR between influenza vaccination and COVID-19 was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.66–1.32). The aOR was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.58–1.46) and 0.92 (95%CI: 0.51–1.67) among those aged 20–59 and ≥60 years, respectively. In secondary analyses, we included 6457 cases and 69272 controls. The imputed aOR was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.79–0.95) among all ages and any delay between swab and symptom onset. Conclusions There was no evidence that COVID-19 cases were more likely to be vaccinated against influenza than controls.

Prior to the recent COVID crisis, we recognised need for more frequent monitoring without the inconvenience of cross-country travel and so piloted an online system of monitoring CRMO. Method: An online assessment form was created using the GDPR-compliant Qualtrics system after consultation with CRMO paediatricians and a specialist nurse. 3 medical students telephoned parents of 31 patients to pilot the assessment form. Responses indicating issues were then referred to the CNS for follow-up. Results: Response data confirmed need for close monitoring with 26% of respondents being seen quarterly, 29% reporting pain greater than 6/ 10, 29% having side-effects and 30% finding current treatment ineffective. 74% of respondents found online assessment extremely/very useful and 58% preferred it to face-to-face appointments.

While face masks’ medical benefits are clear, little is known about their psychological consequences. Drawing on theories of the social functions of emotions and rapid trait impressions, we tested hypotheses on face masks’ effects on emotion-recognition accuracy and social judgments (perceived trustworthiness, likability, and closeness). Our preregistered study with 191 German adults revealed that face masks diminish people’s ability to accurately categorize an emotion expression and make target persons appear less close. Exploratory analyses further revealed that face masks buffered the negative effect of negative (vs. non-negative) emotion expressions on perceptions of trustworthiness, likability, and closeness.

The incidence of mucormycosis has increased in patients who are recovering from COVID-19 and now it has become an epidemic in India.

Six of our patients had nonketotic poorly controlled glycemic status. All patients were mild or asymptomatic as far as COVID-19 clinical symptoms are concerned, but they had high inflammatory markers such as interleukin 6 (IL-6), ferritin, and D-dimer, which are commonly seen in a cytokine storm. Hyperglycemia and COVID-19 infection were consistent features in our patients. We found that COVID-19 patients with poor glycemic control and high inflammatory markers are at high risk for mucormycosis infection. However, the duration from the diagnosis of COVID-19 and the development of symptoms of mucormycosis was varied from 1 to 12 days (mean- 5.71). There was no correlation of the level of IL-6 or D-dimer with the early onset of mucormycosis.

The relevance of the cingulate to the structure and dynamics of large-scale networks ultimately requires a link to functional connectivity. Here, we map fine-grained functional connectivity across the complete extent of the macaque (Macaca fascicularis) cingulate cortex and delineate subdivisions pertaining to distinct identifiable networks. In particular, we identified 4 primary networks representing the functional spectrum of the cingulate: somatomotor, attention-orienting, executive, and limbic.

The protease inhibitor camostat mesylate inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection of lung cells by blocking the virus-activating host cell protease TMPRSS2. Camostat mesylate has been approved for treatment of pancreatitis in Japan and is currently being repurposed for COVID-19 treatment. However, potential mechanisms of viral resistance as well as camostat mesylate metabolization and antiviral activity of metabolites are unclear. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 can employ TMPRSS2-related host cell proteases for activation and that several of them are expressed in viral target cells. However, entry mediated by these proteases was blocked by camostat mesylate. The camostat metabolite GBPA inhibited the activity of recombinant TMPRSS2 with reduced efficiency as compared to camostat mesylate and was rapidly generated in the presence of serum. Importantly, the infection experiments in which camostat mesylate was identified as a SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor involved preincubation of target cells with camostat mesylate in the presence of serum for 2 h and thus allowed conversion of camostat mesylate into GBPA. Indeed, when the antiviral activities of GBPA and camostat mesylate were compared in this setting, no major differences were identified. Our results indicate that use of TMPRSS2-related proteases for entry into target cells will not render SARS-CoV-2 camostat mesylate resistant. Moreover, the present and previous findings suggest that the peak concentrations of GBPA established after the clinically approved camostat mesylate dose (600 mg/day) will result in antiviral activity.",2020-08-05,"Hoffmann, Markus; Hofmann-Winkler, Heike; Smith, Joan C.; Krüger, Nadine; Sørensen, Lambert K.; Søgaard, Ole S.; Hasselstrøm, Jørgen Bo; Winkler, Michael; Hempel, Tim; Raich, Lluís; Olsson, Simon; Yamazoe, Takashi; Yamatsuta, Katsura; Mizuno, Hirotaka; Ludwig, Stephan; Noé, Frank; Sheltzer, Jason M.; Kjolby, Mads; Pöhlmann, Stefan",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.05.237651; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32793911/; https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/08/05/2020.08.05.237651.full.pdf,221096723.0,2020.0,250

The objective of our study was to investigate influenza vaccine and other selected prophylactic vaccines coverage in patients treated with AIT and the attitude of physicians towards vaccinations in this group of patients. We conducted a questionnaire-based study among patients undergoing AIT and physicians. The patients’ survey evaluated influenza and other prophylactic vaccines coverage. The physicians’ survey assessed their experience and opinions on prophylactic vaccinations during AIT. In total, 176 patients (aged 18–79 years) and 120 doctors filled the questionnaires. Patients were assigned to two groups—inhaled allergens group (n = 101) and insect venoms group (n = 68). The number of patients who received any dose (36% and 45%, p = 0.26), as well as two or more doses (17% and 22%, p = 0.43) of influenza vaccine was comparable between two groups. However, in both groups there was a significant (p < 0.0001) decrease in influenza vaccine uptake after the beginning of AIT. Patients from the inhaled allergens group declared a higher tetanus vaccine rate (41% vs. 19%, p = 0.004). The groups did not differ in the pneumococcal and tick-borne encephalitis vaccination coverage. A majority of doctors believe that prophylactic vaccinations in patients undergoing AIT are safe and effective (96% and 94%, respectively); however, as many as 87% of them identify with the need to create clear recommendations regarding vaccinating patients undergoing AIT.

These 18 months of the COVID-19 pandemic have been characterized by phases or waves of new cases, the emergence of new variants of the deadly virus, and several new complications. After providing emergency approval to several drugs and adherence to several public health measures with frequent full and partial lockdowns, the incidence of new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) could not be contained till now on a global basis. Although prophylactic vaccines have inspired optimism, the scarcity of vaccines and several vaccine-related regulations indicate that the vaccine's benefit would not be reaching the people of developing countries anytime soon. In the course of our clinical practice, we used pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN) in 35 patients with chronic liver diseases (CLD), and we found that only two of them were infected with SARS-CoV-2 that was mild in nature. These two patients with CLD have a mild course of disease cured without any specific therapy. Patients with CLD are usually immune-compromised. However, three CLD patients remained free of SARS-CoV-2 although they had COVID-19 patients among their family members. Next, we accomplished two studies for assessing the immune-modulatory capacities of Peg-IFN, 1 and 12 injections following administration of Peg-IFN. The data revealed that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of Peg-IFN-administered CLD patients produced significantly higher levels of some cytokines of innate immunity in comparison with the cytokines produced by PBMC of CLD patients before Peg-IFN intake. The pattern of cytokine responses and absence of infection of SARS-CoV-2 in 33 of 35 CLD patients represent some preliminary observations indicating a possible role of Peg-IFN in patients with CLD. The study may be extended to other chronic infections and cancers in which patients receive Peg-IFN. The role of Peg-IFN for pre- or postexposure prophylaxis in the acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 infection and influencing the natural course of COVID-19 remains to be clarified.

In a one-year sampling campaign, where mengovirus was present along the whole sample processing (addition in the filtration/primary concentration step), significantly different recovery rates were observed between water matrices: usually higher than 1% in drinking water and under 1% in surface water. The results suggest the first stage of the water sampling process and the type of water matrix are the most influential factors for viral RNA recovery. This study also addressed and evidenced mengovirus replication and titration in Vero E6 cultures and showed infectious mengovirus to be recovered from samples of both types of water matrix.

To probe high-risk cities and the impacts of air pollution on public health, this study explores the relationship between the long-term average concentration of air pollution and the city-level case fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19 globally. Then, geographically weighted regression (GWR) is applied to examine the spatial variability of the relationships. Six air pollution factors, including nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), sulfur dioxide (SO(2)), ozone (O(3)), PM(2.5) (particles with diameter ≤2.5 μm), PM(10) (particles with diameter ≤10 μm), and air quality index (AQI), are positively associated with the city-level COVID-19 CFR. Our results indicate that a 1-unit increase in NO(2) (part per billion, PPB), SO(2) (PPB), O(3) (PPB), PM(2.5) (microgram per cubic meter, μg/m(3)), PM(10) (μg/m(3)), AQI (score), is related to a 1.450%, 1.005%, 0.992%, 0.860%, 0.568%, and 0.776% increase in the city-level COVID-19 CFR, respectively. Additionally, the effects of NO(2), O(3), PM(2.5), AQI, and probability of living with poor AQI on COVID-19 spatially vary in view of the estimation of the GWR. In other words, the adverse impacts of air pollution on health are different among the cities. In summary, long-term exposure to air pollution is negatively related to the COVID-19 health outcome, and the relationship is spatially non-stationary. Our research sheds light on the impacts of slashing air pollution on public health in the COVID-19 pandemic to help governments formulate air pollution policies in light of the local situations.

4sxxhglq,Medline,Inhibition of Epstein-Barr virus replication by small interfering RNA targeting the Epstein-Barr virus protease gene.,,unk,"BACKGROUND The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) protease (PR), coded by the BVRF2 gene, is essential for the maturation of the viral capsid and viral DNA packaging during the late stage of the EBV lytic cycle. Like the other herpesvirus serine PRs, EBV PR could be a target for the inhibition of EBV replication. To date, no data have been reported on the inhibition of EBV PR messenger RNA (mRNA) by small interfering RNA (siRNA). METHODS In this study, siRNAs targeting EBV PR were delivered to the epithelial 293 cell line stably transfected with the complete B95-8 EBV episome. EBV DNA and PR mRNA were quantified by real-time PCR in cells and supernatant, protein expression was assessed by immunoblotting, and production of EBV infectious particles in the culture medium was measured by Raji cell superinfection. RESULTS The EBV PR mRNA within the cells was reduced by 73%, the PR protein by 35% and the amount of virus in the cell supernatant was drastically decreased by 86% or 95%, depending on the method. CONCLUSIONS The strong effect of the siRNA targeting EBV PR on EBV replication attests to the crucial role played by EBV PR in the production of infectious particles and suggests that targeting this enzyme can be a new strategy against EBV-associated diseases where virus replication occurs.",,"Larrat, Sylvie; Morand, Patrice; Bas, Ariane; Vigne, Solenne; Crance, Jean-Marc; Boyer, Véronique; Nicod, Sandrine; Grossi, Laurence; Buisson, Marlyse; Burmeister, Wim P; Seigneurin, Jean-Marie; Germi, Raphaële",Antiviral therapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19704168/,22097421.0,,216

Forest outcomes and equity concerns following Ecuador’s suspension of conservation payments,10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105124,no-cc,"Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) are now a prominent policy instrument for conserving tropical forests. PES are voluntary, direct, and contractual: an ES buyer pays an ES steward for adopting conservation practices for a fixed term. A defining feature of PES is its ‘quid pro quo’ conditionality, e.g. stewards are paid only if they deliver contracted conservation outcomes. Most studies on PES effectiveness focus on the steward’s compliance with contract conditions. By contrast, the buyer’s compliance has received scant attention despite the fact that PES programs across the globe have delayed payments, suspended re-enrollment, or shut down altogether. ‘Use-restricting’ PES depend on the continued flow of funding to pay for conservation; however, institutional, political, and economic factors can disrupt or terminate PES funding. What happens when the PES money unexpectedly runs out? Do stewards continue to conserve or revert to their former practices? We use mixed methods to study equity concerns and forest outcomes of an unexpected, two-year interruption in conservation payments to 63 private landowners residing in Ecuador’s Amazon and enrolled in the Socio Bosque program, compared to similar landowners who did not enroll. Using quasi-experimental methods, we found that during the payment suspension period enrolled properties did not maintain their conservation outcomes where deforestation pressures were high (e.g. close to roads). Where deforestation pressures were low, enrolled properties continued to conserve more, on average, than similar properties not enrolled. Findings from 40 interviews and 26 focus groups conducted before, during, and after the payment suspension exposed profound landowner uncertainty regarding their contract rights. Poor official communication and imbalanced PES contract terms reinforced power inequalities between the state and rural ES stewards.

Both samples are $\rm H\alpha$ emitting sources, chosen from the HiZELS narrow-band survey, with metallicities derived from $\rm N2\ (\frac{\rm [NII] \lambda 6584}{\rm H \alpha})$ line ratio. For the mass-matched samples of protocluster and field galaxies, we find that protocluster galaxies with $10^{9.9} \rm M_\odot \leq M_* \leq 10^{10.9} \rm M_\odot$ are metal deficient by $0.10 \pm 0.04$ dex ($2.5\sigma$ significance) compared to their coeval field galaxies. This metal deficiency is absent for low mass galaxies, $\rm M_*<10^{9.9} \rm M_\odot$. Moreover, relying on both SED-derived and $\rm {H\alpha}$ (corrected for dust extinction based on $\rm {M_*}$) SFRs, we find no strong environmental dependence of SFR-$\rm {M_*}$ relation, however, we are not able to rule out the existence of small dependence due to inherent uncertainties in both SFR estimators. The existence of $2.5\sigma$ significant metal deficiency for massive protocluster galaxies favors a model in which funneling of the primordial cold gas through filaments dilutes the metal content of protoclusters at high redshifts ($z \gtrsim 2$). At these redshifts, gas reservoirs in filaments are dense enough to cool down rapidly and fall into the potential well of the protocluster to lower the gas-phase metallicity of galaxies. Moreover, part of this metal deficiency could be originated from galaxy interactions which are more prevalent in dense environments.",2021-02-10,"Sattari, Zahra; Mobasher, Bahram; Chartab, Nima; Darvish, Behnam; Shivaei, Irene; Scoville, Nick; Sobral, David",Unknown,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.05637v1.pdf,245960575.0,2021.0,247

A promising strategy to block the infection consists of using a mutant of the human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a decoy to compete with endogenous ACE2 for the binding to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, which decreases the ability of the virus to enter the host cell. Here, using a computational framework based on the 2D Zernike formalism we investigate details of the molecular binding and evaluate the changes in ACE2-Spike binding compatibility upon mutations occurring in the ACE2 side of the molecular interface. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method by comparing our results with experimental binding affinities changes upon ACE2 mutations, separating ones that increase or decrease binding affinity with an Area Under the ROC curve ranging from 0.66 to 0.93, depending on the magnitude of the effects analyzed. Importantly, the iteration of our approach leads to the identification of a set of ACE2 mutants characterized by an increased shape complementarity with Spike. We investigated the physico-chemical properties of these ACE2 mutants and propose them as bona fide candidates for Spike recognition.",,"Rienzo, Lorenzo Di; Monti, Michele; Milanetti, Edoardo; Miotto, Mattia; Boffi, Alberto; Tartaglia, Gian Gaetano; Ruocco, Giancarlo",Unknown,,234474577.0,,198

While the participants were in an upright standing position electromyography was used to collect data from M. obliquus externus abdominis (OE) muscles, which were activated by unpredictable perturbations applied by a servomotor on a hand-held grip, following the lateral external perturbation to the trunk. The intellectual disabilities group presented contralateral OE muscles latency of 85.71±27.24 ms, and CG group presented 68.62±10.25 ms, no differences was found. Ipsilateral OE muscles latency also did not differs between the groups, ID group showed 96.60±30.20 ms and CG group showed 95.57±33.53 ms. Our study furthers the knowledge about the muscular activity of individuals with intellectual disabilities.

METHODS: Four isolates of TCoV were sequenced over the entire 3′-end structural protein-encoding region and compared phylogenetically along with the corresponding sequences of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strains. RESULTS: The sequence similarity between TCoV and IBV was lower than that among TCoV isolates or that among IBV strains. The variation of sequences between TCoV and IBV was mainly contributed by the S protein gene. The sequence similarity of S gene between TCoV and IBV was lower than that among TCoV isolates or that among IBV strains. The phylogenetic tree based on the S protein region was similar to that based on the entire 3′-end structural protein-encoding region with TCoV isolates and IBV strains grouped in two separate clusters. The phylogenetic tree based on other genes had a very different topology with TCoV isolates randomly forming groups with different IBV strains.

METHODS: An online questionnaire with sociodemographic and COVID-19 knowledge questions was used. RESULTS: A total of 4048 dentists working in the Brazilian public primary and secondary health care system were investigated; 4024 (99.41%) believe that COVID-19 can be transmitted through dental procedures. A fair level of COVID-19 symptoms knowledge by these dentists was observed (3.76±1.27 of 6.00), as well as the skepticism in personal protective equipment (3382; 83.55%) and biosafety procedures (3278; 80.98%) used as an efficient form of COVID-19 transmission prevention. Country region, performance of social distancing, dental specialty, the use of personal protective equipment, and biosafety preventive measures influenced the likelihood of dentists to perform dental treatment, either elective or urgent, during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: The need of extra preventive barriers for dental treatment may bring an extra financial stress in the Brazilian public primary and secondary health care system, as well as in the patient-dentist relationship, which may have to be reframed.

Slow-paced breathing (SPB) has the potential to counteract many of the detrimental effects of COVID-19 that can directly affect sports performance. In this article, we present and justify the use of SPB in athletes by focusing on three key outcomes, namely aerobic endurance performance, emotional well-being, and sleep quality. We examine the physiological mechanisms that underpin these three outcomes and review literature showing that SPB can activate anti-inflammatory pathways, increase lung capacity and, in turn, improve aerobic endurance, emotional well-being, and sleep quality.

The present study evaluated the prevalence of IA in patients with AD and identified potential risk factors of IA using nationwide representative cohort sample data. Methods and Results We defined AD as both aortic dissections and aortic aneurysms. This study used a nationwide representative cohort sample from the Korea National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort database from 1.1million patients. Using χ2 or Fisher's exact tests, the prevalence of the IA in patients with AD and potential risk factors for their concurrence were analyzed. The prevalence of IA in patients with AD was 6.8% (155/2285). The adjusted odds ratios (OR) for having concurrent IA in patients with AD was 3.809 (95% CI, 3.191-4.546; P<0.01).

A common way of representing the underlying processes in these models is as a system of stochastic processes which can be simulated forwards in time. Inference of model parameters based on observed time-series data can then be performed using sequential Monte Carlo techniques. However, using these methods for routine inference problems can be made difficult due to various engineering considerations: allowing model design to change in response to new data and ideas, writing model code which is highly performant, and incorporating all of this with up-to-date statistical techniques. Here, we describe a suite of packages in the R programming language designed to streamline the design and deployment of state space models, targeted at infectious disease modellers but suitable for other domains. Users describe their model in a familiar domain-specific language, which is converted into parallelised C++ code. A fast, parallel, reproducible random number generator is then used to run large numbers of model simulations in an efficient manner. We also provide standard inference and prediction routines, though the model simulator can be used directly if these do not meet the user's needs. These packages provide guarantees on reproducibility and performance, allowing the user to focus on the model itself, rather than the underlying computation. The ability to automatically generate high-performance code that would be tedious and time-consuming to write and verify manually, particularly when adding further structure to compartments, is crucial for infectious disease modellers. Our packages have been critical to the development cycle of our ongoing real-time modelling efforts in the COVID-19 pandemic, and have the potential to do the same for models used in a number of different domains.",,"Knock, E.

Here, we describe transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among >6800 youth and staff at YMCA of the Triangle day camps in North Carolina (March to August 2020). METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of deidentified SARS-CoV-2 cases reported by YMCA day camps in 6 counties (Chatham, Durham, Johnston, Lee, Orange, Wake) over 147 days. Inclusion criteria were youth and staff who enrolled or worked in camps during the study period. Individual-level youth and staff demographics (age, sex, race and ethnicity) were self-reported and linked to SARS-CoV-2 case data by using unique identifiers. RESULTS: Youth (n = 5344; 66% white, 54% male, mean age 8.5 years) had a mean camp attendance rate of 88%; staff (n = 1486) were 64% white and 60% female (mean age 22 years). Seventeen primary SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred during the study period among 9 youth (mean age 9.7 years) and 8 staff (mean age 27 years) who were linked to 3030 contacts present in-person during the week before positive cases. Only 2 secondary infections (1 youth and 1 staff) were linked to primary cases. SARS-CoV-2 primary case attack rate was 0.6% (17/3030), and secondary case transmission rate was 0.07% (2/3011). CONCLUSIONS: Extremely low youth and staff symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 attack and transmission rates were observed over a 147-day period across 54 YMCA camps from March to August 2020, when local coronavirus disease 2019 prevalence peaked.

In this paper, the authors have taken a design thinking approach to spotlight proper objectives for research on this subject. It begins with qualitative research on twenty different perceptions of stakeholders and misconceptions around the current state of NDE. The interpretation is used to define ten value propositions or use cases under ‘NDE for Industry 4.0’ and ‘Industry 4.0 for NDE’ leading up to the clarity of purpose for NDE 4.0—enhanced safety and economic value for stakeholders.

OBJECTIVE: To identify factors that may predispose patients with COVID-19 to severe disease that requires mechanical ventilation (MV). METHODS: We performed a retrospective audit of patients admitted with COVID-19 pneumonia to the intensive care unit (ICU) and medical wards to evaluate the potential associations between comorbid conditions, lymphopenia and IgG subclass deficiency with a need for MV. RESULTS: A total of 51 patients were included in the study. Almost half of the patients (47%; n=24) were documented to have IgG2 deficiency, 43% (n=22) had lymphopenia and 37% (n=19) had combined lymphopenia and IgG2 subclass deficiency. Of the 24 patients who required MV, 75% had IgG2 subclass deficiency, 73% had lymphopenia and 50% had both. The relative risk for requiring MV was 2.64, 3.38 and 2.81 for lymphopenia, IgG2 subclass deficiency and both, respectively.

Intense research produced many controversial results, but also helped some clues to be traced. Thus, it became rather obvious that the disease is caused by environmental factors (though it may be, to some extent, genetically controlled). Among live agents, slow viruses are the only (and theoretically very attractive) possible cause of both BN and urothelial tumours, which occur frequently in BN endemic areas. Apart from occasional visualization of virus-like particles, other evidence supporting this hypothesis has been lacking. The role of biological products, particularly fungal toxins, needs to be further defined. An excess of any heavy metal or radioactive substance as a cause of BN is very unlikely indeed; however, a deficiency of a bio-essential element could not be ruled out. Many epidemiological data indicate that water might be a transmitter of the agent(s). A wide range of ions and minerals have been incriminated, but up to now most of the studies have provided negative or inconclusive results.

However, with the development of extended reality technologies, the use of mixed reality (MR) has shown significant advantages over VR. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the research and development of a newly developed MR and haptic–based dental simulator for tooth preparation and to conduct a preliminary evaluation of its face validity. METHODS: A prototype of the MR dental simulator for tooth preparation was developed by integrating a head-mounted display (HMD), special force feedback handles, a foot pedal, computer hardware, and software program. We recruited 34 participants and divided them into the Novice group (n=17) and Skilled group (n=17) based on their clinical experience. All participants prepared a maxillary right central incisor for an all-ceramic crown in the dental simulator, completed a questionnaire afterward about their simulation experience, and evaluated hardware and software aspects of the dental simulator. RESULTS: Of the participants, 74% (25/34) were satisfied with the overall experience of using the Unidental MR Simulator. Approximately 90% (31/34, 91%) agreed that it could stimulate their interest in learning, and 82% (28/34) were willing to use it for skills training in the future.

DESIGN: Exploratory qualitative study with semistructured interviews. Collected data were analysed using thematic analysis. SETTING: This qualitative study was undertaken with HCWs who mainly worked in intensive care units in six non-profit hospitals in Vienna, Austria. Data were collected from June 2020 to January 2021. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 30 HCWs (13 medical doctors, 11 qualified nursing staff, 2 nurse assistants, 2 physiotherapists and 2 technical/cleaning staff) who were in direct and indirect contact with patients with COVID-19 were included. RESULTS: Three overall themes resulted as relevant: challenges due to lack of preparedness, structural conditions, and physical and mental health of HCWs. Lack of preparedness included delayed infection prevention and control (IPC) guidelines, shortages of personal protective equipment combined with staff shortages (especially of nursing staff) and overworked personnel. Physical and mental strains resulted from HCWs being overworked and working permanently on alert to face medical uncertainties and the critical conditions of patients. HCWs lacked recognition on multiple levels and dealt with stigma and avoidance behaviour of colleagues. CONCLUSION: To mitigate HCWs’ occupational health risks and staff turnover, we propose context-specific recommendations. The number of available essential workers in care of patients with COVID-19, especially nursing staff, should be carefully planned and increased to avert chronic work overload.

n660sc0k,Medline; PMC,Hypoxia induces expression of angiotensin‐converting enzyme II in alveolar epithelial cells: Implications for the pathogenesis of acute lung injury in COVID‐19,10.14814/phy2.14854,cc-by,"SARS‐CoV‐2 uptake by lung epithelial cells is a critical step in the pathogenesis of COVID‐19. Viral entry is dependent on the binding of the viral spike protein to the angiotensin converting enzyme II protein (ACE2) on the host cell surface, followed by proteolytic cleavage by a host serine protease such as TMPRSS2. Infection of alveolar epithelial cells (AEC) in the distal lung is a key feature in progression to the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We hypothesized that AEC expression of ACE2 is induced by hypoxia. In a murine model of hypoxic stress (12% FiO2), the total lung Ace2 mRNA and protein expression was significantly increased after 24 hours in hypoxia compared to normoxia (21% FiO2). In experiments with primary murine type II AEC, we found that exposure to hypoxia either in vivo (prior to isolation) or in vitro resulted in greatly increased AEC expression of both Ace2 (mRNA and protein) and of Tmprss2. However, when isolated type II AEC were maintained in culture over 5 days, with loss of type II cell characteristics and induction of type I cell features, Ace2 expression was greatly reduced, suggesting that this expression was a feature of only this subset of AEC. Finally, in primary human small airway epithelial cells (SAEC), ACE2 mRNA and protein expression were also induced by hypoxia, as was binding to purified spike protein.

Will I become a millionaire in the next 5 years? When will I get married? These are the questions raised by several of us. There are people in this world who do forecasting and at least try to provide answers to such questions. Neural networks so far are not successful in doing such kinds of forecasts. But they do certainly forecast the futures where the past data contains some discoverable patterns. The topic of this chapter is to learn how to train neural networks to perform such kinds of forecasts. These are called time series forecasting.

In Poland, obligatory wearing of masks in public spaces was introduced on April 10th, 2020;a relaxation of previous universal measures was announced on May 29th, 2020, limiting use to indoor public places. Objective: to assess use of masks or other protective devices in public spaces in Poland during the SARS-Cov-2 epidemic. Methods: A non-participatory covert observational study was conducted on three dates, (10.05/18.05/ 25.05.2020) at public spaces in 13 regions with different risks. Ten consecutive individuals were observed by each of 82 medical students (n=2460 observations), using a structured checklist. Results: Among 2353 observed persons, the female/male ratios were 1.0, 1.1, and 1.0 on the three dates. Almost three quarters - 73.6% (n=552/750) were using masks on date 1, 66.5% (544/818) on date 2;and 65.7% (516/785) on date 3. Cloth masks predominated on all dates (64.7%-62.3%-62.6%), followed by medical (23.4%-28.5%-26.9%). Being female (OR=1.77-1.47-1.53 respectively) and location in a closed space (OR=2.60-2.59-2.32) were each associated with higher usage. Participants in sports were about two times less likely to use masks (OR=0.64-0.53-0.53) as compared to other activities. The proportion using masks correctly decreased gradually over time (364/552;65.9%;339/544;62.3% and 304/516;58.9%). More females wore masks correctly (date 1: 205/294;69.7% vs 159/258;61.6%, and date 3: 186/284;65.5% vs 118/232;50.9%;p=0.045;p=0.0008 respectively). Uncovered noses (47.3%-52.7%) and masks around the neck (39.2%-42.6%) were the most frequent incorrect practices.

qzq7savs,Medline; PMC; WHO,Community predictors of COVID‐19 cases and deaths in Massachusetts: Evaluating changes over time using geospatially refined data,10.1111/irv.12926,cc-by,"BACKGROUND: The COVID‐19 pandemic has highlighted the need for targeted local interventions given substantial heterogeneity within cities and counties. Publicly available case data are typically aggregated to the city or county level to protect patient privacy, but more granular data are necessary to identify and act upon community‐level risk factors that can change over time. METHODS: Individual COVID‐19 case and mortality data from Massachusetts were geocoded to residential addresses and aggregated into two time periods: “Phase 1” (March–June 2020) and “Phase 2” (September 2020 to February 2021). Institutional cases associated with long‐term care facilities, prisons, or homeless shelters were identified using address data and modeled separately. Census tract sociodemographic and occupational predictors were drawn from the 2015–2019 American Community Survey. We used mixed‐effects negative binomial regression to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs), accounting for town‐level spatial autocorrelation. RESULTS: Case incidence was elevated in census tracts with higher proportions of Black and Latinx residents, with larger associations in Phase 1 than Phase 2. Case incidence associated with proportion of essential workers was similarly elevated in both Phases. Mortality IRRs had differing patterns from case IRRs, decreasing less substantially between Phases for Black and Latinx populations and increasing between Phases for proportion of essential workers. Mortality models excluding institutional cases yielded stronger associations for age, race/ethnicity, and essential worker status. CONCLUSIONS: Geocoded home address data can allow for nuanced analyses of community disease patterns, identification of high‐risk subgroups, and exclusion of institutional cases to comprehensively reflect community risk.",2021-11-10,"Spangler, Keith R.; Patil, Prasad; Peng, Xiaojing; Levy, Jonathan I.; Lane, Kevin J.; Tieskens, Koen F.; Carnes, Fei; Klevens, R.

The diagnosis of HLH and its subtype Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) remains a challenge. Interleukin 18 (IL-18) is emerging as a potential biomarker for HLH/MAS but is currently not a part of diagnostic criteria. This systematic review aimed to assess the potential role of IL-18 in the diagnosis and monitoring of HLH and MAS. METHODS This review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. PubMed and Embase were searched on January 30th 2020. Studies included all subtypes of HLH and a range of underlying disorders in both children and adults. RESULTS A total of 14 studies were included. Generally, serum IL-18 was elevated in both primary and secondary HLH (>1,000 pg/ml) compared with other inflammatory conditions and with healthy individuals, thus serum IL-18 may be able to discriminate between HLH and other inflammatory conditions. Significantly increased IL-18 (>10,000 pg/ml) was also consistently described in MAS compared with other subtypes of HLH. The ability of IL-18 to distinguish MAS from systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is less unambiguous, as IL-18 levels >100,000 pg/ml was described in sJIA patients both with and without MAS. CONCLUSION IL-18 may help differentiate between HLH subtypes and other inflammatory conditions. Since HLH and MAS are rare disorders, only few and relatively small studies exist on the subject. Larger, prospective multi-center studies are called for to assess the diagnostic precision of IL-18 for HLH and MAS.",2020-10-31,"Krei, Julia Marie; Møller, Holger Jon; Larsen, Julie Brogaard",Clinical and experimental immunology,https://doi.org/10.1111/cei.13543; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33128796/,226224285.0,2020.0,253

Fortunately, large-scale vaccination can mitigate the impact of COVID-19 by making the disease milder and less common. Although 75.2% of the United States population has received at least 1 dose of a COVID-19 vaccines thus far, concerns regarding vaccine side effects have contributed to vaccine hesitancy. Furthermore, nearly 50% of adults in the United States are concerned not only about side effects, but about their downstream impact, including missed work.The goal of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the effect of messenger RNA vaccine adverse effects on the propensity to miss work among employees associated with a single, large academic health center.Using Qualtrics, all employees, including faculty, staff, and trainees, of 5 large departments were surveyed to determine whether they received the COVID-19 vaccine and which type, and any symptoms they experienced after receipt of either vaccine dose. We hypothesized that vaccine recipients would be more likely to miss work or feel sick enough to miss work following the second dose.Thirty-seven percent of respondents experienced events severe enough that they needed to miss work from either of the doses, with the majority (27.8%) related to the second dose. These findings are consistent with and expand on the results from the phase 3 trials for Pfizer-BionTech and Moderna, which showed that vaccine side effects were more common after the second dose than after the first dose. Our statistically significant finding was more common among Asians, women, trainees/house staff, and nonphysician clinical employees.With an increasing number of individuals taking the vaccine, employers will need to account for the impact of adverse effects on their employees' ability to work.

8kl1s4bw,WHO,The Secretive Liaison of Particulate Matter and SARS-CoV-2. A Hypothesis and Theory Investigation,,unk,"As the novel coronavirus disease sweeps across the world, there is growing speculation on the role that atmospheric factors may have played on the different distribution of SARS-CoV-2, and on the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19. Knowing the role that environmental factors play in influenza virus outbreaks, environmental pollution and, in particular, atmospheric airborne (particulate matter, PM) has been considered as a potential key factor in the spread and mortality of COVID-19. A possible role of the PM as the virus carrier has also been debated. The role of PM in exacerbating respiratory and cardiovascular disease has been well recognized. Accumulating evidence support the hypothesis that PM can trigger inflammatory response at molecular, cellular and organ levels. On this basis, we developed the hypothesis that PM may play a role as a booster of COVID-19 rather than as a carrier of SARS-CoV-2. To support our hypothesis, we analyzed the molecular signatures detected in cells exposed to PM samples collected in one of the most affected areas by the COVID-19 outbreak, in Italy. T47D human breast adenocarcinoma cells were chosen to explore the global gene expression changes induced by the treatment with organic extracts of PM 2.5. The analysis of the KEGG's pathways showed modulation of several gene networks related to the leucocyte transendothelial migration, cytoskeleton and adhesion system. Three major biological process were identified, including coagulation, growth control and immune response. The analysis of the modulated genes gave evidence for the involvement of PM in the endothelial disease, coagulation disorders, diabetes and reproductive toxicity, supporting the hypothesis that PM, directly or through molecular interplay, affects the same molecular targets as so far known for SARS-COV-2, contributing to the cytokines storm and to the aggravation of the symptoms triggered by COVID-19. We provide evidence for a plausible cooperation of receptors and transmembrane proteins, targeted by PM and involved in COVID-19, together with new insights into the molecular interplay of chemicals and pathogens that could be of importance for sustaining public health policies and developing new therapeutic approaches.",,"Mescoli, Ada; Maffei, Giangabriele; Pillo, Gelsomina; Bortone, Giuseppe; Marchesi, Stefano; Morandi, Elena; Ranzi, Andrea; Rotondo, Francesca; Serra, Stefania; Vaccari, Monica; Zauli Sajani, Stefano; Mascolo, Maria Grazia; Jacobs, Miriam Naomi; Colacci, Annamaria",Front Genet,,226278692.0,,335
nqbhkw0d,WHO,The psychiatry virtual-on-call experience: Can it improve confidence of foundation and GP trainees with out-of-hours work in psychiatry?,,unk,"Aims Out-of-hours (‘on-call’) work can be perceived by junior doctors to be a daunting experience, associated with feeling unprepared and less supported. Simulated on-call programmes have been used to great effect in medicine and surgery to improve junior doctors’ skills in task prioritisation, interpersonal communication and confidence on-call. However, few psychiatry-specific programmes exist. We aimed to: i) Develop a psychiatry specific virtual-on-call programme, ii) Investigate if the virtual-on-call programme improved confidence amongst junior trainees in key areas of psychiatry practice. Method The Psychiatry Virtual-On-Call programme commenced in December 2020. It involves attending an introductory on-call lecture, followed later in the rotation by a 2-hour simulated on-call shift. All trainees are expected to attend during their attachment and the simulated shifts are ongoing. During the shift, trainees are ‘bleeped’ with different psychiatry specific tasks. They work through the tasks, using local intranet policies and telephone advice from the on-call psychiatry registrar. Due to COVID-19 the sessions were delivered virtually. Participants completed a questionnaire evaluating confidence in ten domains, rated on a Likert scale from 0–10. Questionnaires were completed at four time-points during the programme;pre- and post-introductory lecture and pre- and post-simulated shift. Scores were compared using Mann-Whitney U tests. Significance was defined as P < 0.05 with Bonferroni correction applied for multiple testing. Result Twenty-nine trainees attended the introductory lecture, 25 and 21 trainees completed the pre- and post-lecture questionnaire respectively. A non-significant improvement in confidence was reported in three domains: seclusions reviews, prescribing, detention under the mental health act. At the time of writing, ten trainees had attended the on-call shift. All participants completed a pre- and post-session questionnaire. The on-call shift was a useful learning experience (median score 9), and significantly increased perceived preparedness for on-call work from 3/10 to 7/10 (p < 0.001). Confidence was significantly improved in seven domains, most markedly in seclusion reviews, prescribing and mental health act tasks. Conclusion The psychiatry virtual-on-call programme fills a niche in the training curriculum and is perceived by trainees to be a useful learning experience. The introductory lecture improved confidence in several domains, but not as effectively as the on-call shift. The on-call shift was well received by participants and significantly improved confidence in 7/10 domains. In summary, the virtual-on-call experience improves preparedness for out-of-hours psychiatry work. Follow-up of participants at the end of their psychiatry rotation will ascertain if they felt the programme to be useful during out-of-hours work.",,"Harrison, Charlotte Blamey Helen Roddick Alistair Saunders Kate Malhotra Tina",BJPsych open,,235464469.0,,401

Our model is initialized using the daily counts of active and confirmed COVID-19 cases across the US. Based on our model predictions for the March 14-16 timeframe, the national epidemic peak could be expected to arrive by early June, corresponding to a daily active count of ≈ 7% of the US population, if no containment plans are implemented. Epidemic peaks are expected to arrive in the states of Washington and New York by May 21 and 25, respectively. With a modest 25% reduction in COVID-19 transmissibility via community-level interventions, the epidemic progression could be delayed by up to 34 days. Wholesale interstate traffic restriction is ineffective in delaying the epidemic outbreak, but it does desynchronize the arrival of state-wise epidemic peaks, which could potentially alleviate the burden on limited available medical resources.

The infections are generally acquired by transmission of large respiratory droplets and can be nosocomial in origin with many documented outbreaks on specialised transplant units. Typically, the infections begin as upper RTIs, with cough or rhinorrhoea predominating. Many will resolve at this stage, but more immunocompromised patients, typically closer in time to their SOT or HSCT, may develop progressive infection to lower RTI or pneumonia. The most common RTI pathogens are influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses and respiratory syncytial viruses.

To achieve secure and reliable identity verification in eLearning exams, it has been suggested to employ face recognition technologies for remote student authentication in online examinations. However, novel attacks on face recognition in eLearning systems have rarely been considered in the scientific literature.In this work, we investigate the feasibility of so-called face morphing attacks in eLearning systems. Such attacks can be launched in scenarios where students are authenticated via identity documents containing face images that are remotely presented prior to online examinations. In this relevant scenario, students are able to fool human examination and automated face recognition by morphing their face image with that of an accomplice, e.g. fellow student. Resulting morphed face images contain biometric information of both subjects contributing to it. Consequentially, an accomplice could take part in an online examination for a student with high probability of passing an identity verification unnoticed. We assess the vulnerability of a commercial and an open-source face recognition system to said attack. To this end, a realistic dataset of morphing attacks is collected. It is shown that automated face recognition in eLearning systems can be tricked with alarmingly high success chance. © 2021 IEEE.",,"Rathgeb, C.; Poppelmann, K.; Busch, C.","2021 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference, EDUCON 2021",https://doi.org/10.1109/educon46332.2021.9454128,235475695.0,,211

In NSST-LBNDP, the input image is first decomposed by NSST, followed by introduction of non-linearity on the NSST coefficients by computing local energy features. The local energy features are next normalized into 8-bit values. The multiscale NSST is used to provide translational invariance and has flexible directional sensitivity to catch more anisotropic information of an image. The normalised NSST subband features are next decomposed into bit-plane slices in order to capture very fine to coarse subband details. Then each bit-plane slices of all the subbands are encoded by exploiting the dissimilarity relationship between each neighbouring pixel and its adjacent neighbours.

The diagnosis of COVID-19 in these transplant recipients may require extensive laboratory testing and high clinical suspicion, as atypical clinical manifestations or other respiratory viral infections are common in this patient population. The underlying malignancies, immunosuppressed state, frequently observed coinfections, and advanced age in some patients may also predispose them to worse clinical outcomes. Similar outcomes have been previously described with other human coronaviruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Many hematopoietic stem cell transplant organizations have issued elaborative guidelines that aim to prevent transmission and hence adverse patient outcomes. All potential donors are thoroughly screened, and donated products are cryopreserved in advance. Potential hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients are also screened, and most nonurgent transplant cases with low risk of progression and/or death are deferred. Current hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients should adhere to precaution and isolation measures, while their transplant units should also follow strict safety protocols, similar to other infectious outbreaks. The prolonged susceptibility of hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients to respiratory viral infections might necessitate extending these measures even after the peak of the outbreak until a gradually return to normality is possible.",,"Esagian, Stepan M; Giannis, Dimitrios; Ziogas, Ioannis A; Gianni, Panagiota; Sala, Elisa; Döhner, Hartmut",Exp. clin. transplant,,232080178.0,,211

Firstly, the structures and bonding states of silver–tetrylene complexes (NHE–Ag) and bis-silver–tetrylene complexes (NHE–Ag-bis) were investigated using density functional theory (DFT) at the BP86 level with the def2-SVP and def2-TZVPP basis sets. Secondly, the inhibitory capabilities of the carbene complexes (NHC–Ag and NHC–Ag-bis) and the two potential drugs (ribavirin and remdesivir) on human-protein ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 protease PDB6LU7 were evaluated using molecular docking simulation. The carbene ligand NHC bonds in a head-on configuration with AgCl and (AgCl)(2), whereas, the other NHE (E = Si and Ge) tetrylene ligands bond in a side-on mode to the metal fragments. The bond dissociation energy (BDE) of the NHE–Ag bond in the complex families follows the order of NHC–Ag > NHSi–Ag > NHGe–Ag and NHSi–Ag-bis > NHGe–Ag-bis > NHC–Ag-bis. The natural bond orbital analysis implies that the [NHE(Ph)→AgCl] and [(NHE(Ph))(2)→(AgCl)(2)] donations are derived mainly from the σ- and π-contributions of the ligands. The docking results indicate that both the ACE2 and PDB6LU7 proteins are strongly inhibited by silver–carbene NHC–Ag, bis-silver–carbene NHC–Ag-bis, ribavirin, and remdesivir with the docking score energy values varying from −17.5 to −16.5 kcal mol(−1) and −16.9 to −16.6 kcal mol(−1), respectively. The root-mean-square deviation values were recorded to be less than 2 Å in all the calculated systems.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of WeChat-based telehealth services on the preoperative follow-up of infants with congenital heart disease (CHD) during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 190 infants with CHD who underwent remote follow-up via WeChat from December 2019 to May 2020 in Fujian Maternity and Child Health Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University. In addition, the psychological benefits of WeChat on the parents of these infants were analyzed. RESULTS: In total, 190 infants were involved in this study, including 72 cases of ventricular septal defects, 42 cases of patent ductus arteriosus, 55 cases of atrial septal defects, 3 cases of tetralogy of Fallot, 2 cases of endocardial cushion defects, 12 cases of pulmonary stenosis, 2 cases of total anomalous pulmonary venous connection and 2 cases of aortic arch constriction. During the follow-up period, 48 infants who received surgical indications were hospitalized in time for surgical treatment. It was recommended that 10 infants with respiratory tract infections be treated in local hospitals through the WeChat platform. We provided feeding guidance to 28 infants with dysplasia through the WeChat platform.

However, identifying clinically-relevant content in social media without manual labeling is a challenge because of the sheer volume of irrelevant data. We present an unsupervised, iterative approach to mine clinically relevant information from social media data, which begins by heuristically filtering for HCP-authored texts and incorporates topic modeling and concept extraction with MetaMap. This approach identifies granular topics and tweets with high clinical relevance from a set of about 52 million COVID-19-related tweets from January to mid-June 2020. We also show that because the technique does not require manual labeling, it can be used to identify emerging topics on a week-to-week basis.

We only detected one case of placental infection, which was associated with intrauterine demise of the fetus. We then isolated and differentiated primary trophoblasts from non-pathological human placentas at term, and exposed them to SARS-CoV-2 virions. Unlike for positive control cells Vero E6, we were not able to detect the virus inside cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts or in the supernatant four days after infection. As a mechanism of defense, we hypothesized that trophoblasts at term do not express ACE2 and TMPRSS, the two main host membrane receptors for SARS-CoV-2 entry. The quantification of these proteins in the placenta during pregnancy confirmed the absence of TMPRSS2 at the surface of the syncytium. Surprisingly, a transiently induced experimental expression of TMPRSS2 did not allow the entry or replication of the virus in differentiated trophoblasts.

This study aimed to investigate the patients-perceived drug shortages experience and their view on outcomes in different European hospital settings. Furthermore, we wanted to explore information preferences on drug shortages. METHODS: A retrospective, cross sectional, a mixed method study was conducted in six European hospital settings. One hospital (H) from each of this country agreed to participate: Bosnia and Herzegovina (H-BiH), Croatia (H-CR), Germany (H-GE), Greece (H-GR), Serbia (H-SE) and Poland (H-PO). Recruitment and data collection was conducted over 27 months from November 2017 until January 2020. Overall, we surveyed 607 patients which completed paper-based questionnaire. Questions related to: general information (demographic data), basic knowledge on drug shortages, drug shortages experienced during hospitalization and information preferences on drug shortage. Differences between hospital settings were analyzed using Chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test. For more complex contingency tables, Monte Carlo simulations (N = 2000) were applied for Fisher’s test. Post-hoc hospital-wise analyses were performed using Fisher’s exact tests. False discovery rate was controlled using the Bonferroni method. Analyses were performed using R: a language and environment for statistical computing (v 3.6.3). RESULTS: 6 % of patients reported experiences with drug shortages while hospitalized which led to a deterioration of their health. The majority of affected patients were hospitalized at hematology and/or oncology wards in H-BiH, H-PO and H-GE. H-BiH had the highest number of affected patients (18.1 %, N = 19/105, p < 0.001) while the fewest patients were in H-SE (1 %, N = 1/100, p = 0.001). In addition, 82.5 %, (N = 501/607) of respondents wanted to be informed of alternative treatment options if there was a drug shortage without a generic substitute available. Majority of these patients (66.4 %, N = 386/501) prefer to be informed by a healthcare professional. CONCLUSIONS: Although drug shortages led to serious medical consequences, our findings show that most of the patients did not perceive shortages as a problem. One possible interpretation is that good hospital management practices by healthcare professionals helped to mitigate the perceived impact of shortages. Our study highlights the importance of a good communication especially between patients and healthcare professionals in whom our patients have the greatest trust.

However, one potential limiting factor is restricted quantity and diversity given the single nation patient cohort used. In this study, we introduce COVID-Net CT-2, enhanced deep neural networks for COVID-19 detection from chest CT images trained on the largest quantity and diversity of multinational patient cases in research literature. We introduce two new CT benchmark datasets, the largest comprising a multinational cohort of 4,501 patients from at least 15 countries. We leverage explainability to investigate the decision-making behaviour of COVID-Net CT-2, with the results for select cases reviewed and reported on by two board-certified radiologists with over 10 and 30 years of experience, respectively. The COVID-Net CT-2 neural networks achieved accuracy, COVID-19 sensitivity, PPV, specificity, and NPV of 98.1%/96.2%/96.7%/99%/98.8% and 97.9%/95.7%/96.4%/98.9%/98.7%, respectively. Explainability-driven performance validation shows that COVID-Net CT-2's decision-making behaviour is consistent with radiologist interpretation by leveraging correct, clinically relevant critical factors. The results are promising and suggest the strong potential of deep neural networks as an effective tool for computer-aided COVID-19 assessment.

Traditional donor hierarchy favours a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling donor (MSD) over an HLA-matched unrelated donor (MUD), followed by alternative donors such as haploidentical donors or unrelated cord blood. However, haploidentical HSCT (hHSCT) may be entailed with significant advantages: besides a potentially increased graft-vs.-leukaemia effect, the immediate availability of a relative as well as the possibility of a second donation for additional cellular therapies may impact on outcome. The key question in hHSCT is how, and how deeply, to deplete donor T-cells. More T cells in the graft confer faster immune reconstitution with consecutively lower infection rates, however, greater numbers of T-cells might be associated with higher rates of graft-vs.-host disease (GvHD). Two different methods for reduction of alloreactivity have been established: in vivo T-cell suppression and ex vivo T-cell depletion (TCD). Ex vivo TCD of the graft uses either positive selection or negative depletion of graft cells before infusion. In contrast, T-cell-repleted grafts consisting of non-manipulated bone marrow or peripheral blood grafts require intense in vivo GvHD prophylaxis. There are two major T-cell replete protocols: one is based on post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy), while the other is based on anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG; Beijing protocol). Published data do not show an unequivocal benefit for one of these three platforms in terms of overall survival, non-relapse mortality or disease recurrence. In this review, we discuss the pros and cons of these three different approaches to hHSCT with an emphasis on the significance of the existing data for children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.",2021-12-24,"Kleinschmidt, Katharina; Lv, Meng; Yanir, Asaf; Palma, Julia; Lang, Peter; Eyrich, Matthias",Front Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8740090/,,2021.0,269

The prevalence rate of telecommuting in Sapin in 2019 was 5%, while this rate grew up to 34% during de COVID-19 pandemic.ObjectivesThe purpose of this poster is to make a review about how telecommuting affects the employees’ mental health.MethodsA review os the available literature on employees’ menthal health.ResultsMost employers who offer telecommuting consider it a strategic decision for their businesses: it could reduce the expenses of physically accommodating the employees, and it might help employers to contact their subordinates anytime, if needed. Many articles in the popular press about telecommuting extol the benefits of this practice on employees’ health (work-life balance, reduction of travel expenses). However, only a handful of empirical studies substantiate these claims (job satisfaction, quality of life, and role-related stress). Less discussed is the potential of telecommuting to have a negative impact on employees’ health. It may increase both social and professional isolation, which in turn is associated with higher levels of emotional exhaustion, cynicism, cognitive stress complaints and lower levels of work engagement.ConclusionsFinally, although it is not as effective as personal contact, organizations may stimulate qualitative virtual interaction with coworkers by providing robust online meeting tools and infrastructure, so users can seamlessly collaborate regardless of their physical location.",,"Molina Lietor, M.

mwiixli6,BioRxiv,Differential relationships between brain structure and dual task walking in young and older adults,10.1101/2021.11.04.467303,biorxiv,"Almost 25% of all older adults experience difficulty walking. Mobility difficulties for older adults are more pronounced when performing a simultaneous cognitive task while walking (i.e., dual task walking). Although it is known that aging results in widespread brain atrophy, few studies have integrated across more than one neuroimaging modality to comprehensively examine the structural neural correlates that may underly dual task walking in older age. We collected spatiotemporal gait data during single and dual task walking for 37 young (18-34 years) and 23 older adults (66-86 years). We also collected T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted MRI scans to determine how brain structure differs in older age and relates to dual task walking. We addressed two aims: 1) to characterize age differences in brain structure across a range of metrics including volumetric, surface, and white matter microstructure; and 2) to test for age group differences in the relationship between brain structure and the dual task cost (DTcost) of gait speed and variability. Key findings included widespread brain atrophy for the older adults, with the most pronounced age differences in brain regions related to sensorimotor processing. We also found multiple associations between regional brain atrophy and greater DTcost of gait speed and variability for the older adults. The older adults showed a relationship of both thinner temporal cortex and shallower sulcal depth in the frontal, sensorimotor, and parietal cortices with greater DTcost of gait. Additionally, the older adults showed a relationship of ventricular volume and superior longitudinal fasciculus free-water corrected axial and radial diffusivity with greater DTcost of gait. These relationships were not present for the young adults. Stepwise multiple regression found sulcal depth in the left precentral gyrus, axial diffusivity in the superior longitudinal fasciculus, and sex to best predict DTcost of gait speed, and cortical thickness in the superior temporal gyrus to best predict DTcost of gait variability for older adults. These results contribute to scientific understanding of how individual variations in brain structure are associated with mobility function in aging. This has implications for uncovering mechanisms of brain aging and for identifying target regions for mobility interventions for aging populations. CONTRIBUTION TO THE FIELD Older age is associated with poorer mobility, including difficulties in performing a cognitive task while walking (i.e., dual task walking). Our work contributes to the field by examining multimodal structural neuroimaging data to characterize how brain structure relates to dual task walking in young versus older adults. We extracted multiple indices from T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans that describe morphological characteristics of brain gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid. We analyzed MRI and gait data from 37 young (18-34 years) and 23 older (66-86 years) adults. We identified multiple relationships between regional brain atrophy and greater dual task costs (DTcosts) to gait, i.e., greater slowing of gait speed and greater increases in gait variability from single to dual task walking. Specifically, for the older adults only, thinner temporal cortex and shallower sulcal depth in the frontal, sensorimotor, and parietal cortices were associated with larger DTcosts to walking. Additionally, for the older adults only, ventricular volume and superior longitudinal fasciculus free-water corrected axial and radial diffusivity were associated with larger DTcosts. These findings illustrate that temporal, frontoparietal and sensorimotor brain structures are associated with walking DTcosts in older adults, highlighting potential targets for interventions.",2021-11-05,"Hupfeld, KE; Geraghty, JM; McGregor, HR; Hass, CJ; Pasternak, O; Seidler, RD",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.04.467303,243827339.0,2021.0,551

The generalizability of this observation on ACS admissions and possible related causes in countries with low COVID-19 incidence are not known. HYPOTHESIS: ACS admissions were reduced in a country spared by COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide study on the incidence rates of ACS-related admissions during a 6-week period of the COVID-19 outbreak and the corresponding control period in 2019 in Greece, a country with strict social measures, low COVID-19 incidence, and no excess in mortality. RESULTS: ACS admissions in the COVID-19 (n = 771) compared with the control (n = 1077) period were reduced overall (incidence rate ratio [IRR]: 0.72, P < .001) and for each ACS type (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI]: IRR: 0.76, P = .001; non-STEMI: IRR: 0.74, P < .001; and unstable angina [UA]: IRR: 0.63, P = .002). The decrease in STEMI admissions was stable throughout the COVID-19 period (temporal correlation; R2 = 0.11, P = .53), whereas there was a gradual decline in non-STEMI/UA admissions (R2 = 0.75, P = .026) following the progressively stricter social measures. During the COVID-19 period, patients admitted with ACS presented more frequently with left ventricular systolic impairment (22.2 vs 15.5% control period; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: We observed a reduction in ACS hospitalizations during the COVID-19 outbreak in a country with strict social measures, low community transmission, and no excess in mortality.

Under real conditions there are still unknowns that limit this application including the influence of suspended solids and natural organic matter. This work aims to investigate the influence of two key parameters, suspended solids and natural organic matter, on the efficiency of UVC disinfection of surface water to achieve the drinking water quality requirements established by the WHO for point of use (POU) technologies. Kaolinite (turbidity agent) and humic acids (HA, model of organic matter) were used in a factorial design of experiments (Turbidity from 0 to 5 NTU, and HA from 0 to 3.5 mg/L) to investigate their effect on UVC inactivation of MS2 phage in surface water. A collimated beam (12 W) and a commercial UVC disinfection flow system (16 W) designed to provide drinking water at households were used. The UVC flow system both in the laboratory and in the field was able to achieve the reduction requirements established by WHO (LRV >3.5 for all tested conditions), confirming the good performance of the studied UVC disinfection system. The results found in the lab were used to establish a numerical model that predicts the disinfection rate constant as a function of water turbidity and transmittance at 254 nm (confidence level>95%). The model permitted to elucidate the critical effect of low concentrations of HA in reducing the inactivation rate by 40% for 3.5 mg/L-HA compared with 0, the non-significant detrimental effect of turbidity lower than 5 NTU, and the lack of synergistic effects between both parameters at these levels. The UVC flow system was also tested in the field, in Tzabalho, Chiapas (Mexico), and Antioquia (Colombia), with spiked MS2 into natural surface water.

After assessing the cases of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia associated to this vaccine, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) supported the administration of 2 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine with no age restrictions. Nevertheless, Spain decided not to administer the second dose of this vaccine to < 60-year-olds. The government sponsored a clinical trial (CombiVacS) to assess the immunogenicity response to a Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine dose in adults primed with the AstraZeneca vaccine. The positive results backed the Public Health Commission and the Spanish Ministry of Health to offer the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine as the booster. Nevertheless, regional public health authorities—responsible for administering vaccines—believed that, following the EMA’s decision, an AstraZeneca booster dose should be given. The public confrontation of these 2 positions forced the Spanish Health Ministry to request the signature of an informed consent form to those individuals willing to receive the AstraZeneca vaccine booster and rejecting the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine dose. Eventually, it was decided that these essential workers could choose the vaccine but signing an informed consent form.

Human bocavirus (HBoV) is one of the relatively newly discovered viruses that has been detected worldwide and causes respiratory and gastrointestinal infections, mainly in pediatric patients. However, little is known about the pathogenicity and evolution of HBoV. This systematic review was initiated to clarify the prevalence and circulating genotypes of HBoV in both respiratory and stool samples from patients of all age groups in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) from 2005 to February 2021. We performed an electronic search through Science Direct, Scopus, PubMed, Mendeley and Cochrane Library databases. We included all studies reporting the detection rate of HBoV in the MENA region. Data were extracted, and the quality of the included articles was assessed. We included articles containing data on HBoV only or with other respiratory or gastrointestinal viral infections. Review articles, case studies, and animal and environmental studies were excluded. The final number of articles included in this study was 65 articles. The results showed that the HBoV prevalence in children was the lowest in Iran (0%) and the highest in Egypt (56.8%). In adults, the lowest and the highest prevalence were reported in Iran, with values of 0% and 6.6%, respectively. Regarding the respiratory cases, our findings revealed no significant difference between HBoV prevalence among the tested categories (p-value = 0.998). The present study has shown that HBoV is common in children and adults in the MENA region. This systematic review highlights the need for more data on the role of coinfection of HBoV and other viruses, for instance, SARS-CoV-2 in children with acute bronchiolitis.",2021-11-10,"Abdelqader, Rana; Hasan, Hanan; Alanagreh, Lo’ai",Pathogens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34832613/; https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens10111456,244084446.0,2021.0,278

It may be difficult to report ECG in a supine posture for those who are unable to adopt the supine posture because of certain circumstances such as acute respiratory distress syndrome—patients who are placed in a prone position for long periods to improve oxygenation. Few data are available on the impact of the prone position on the ECG recording with electrodes on the posterior chest. Examining and analyzing the type and extent of changes observed in the prone ECG in healthy adults have become vitally valuable. METHODS: A cross-sectional observational study enrolled forty healthy adults (24 males and 16 females) aged between 18 and 40 years. The ECG was performed in two different body positions, supine and prone. Influence of prone position on the heart rate, mean QRS axis, amplitude, morphology, duration, mean T wave axis and polarity, mean P wave axis, PR, and mean QTc duration was evaluated. RESULTS: The mean heart rate was higher in the prone position (73.2 ± 12.4 bpm) compared with the supine position (69.5 ± 11.5 bpm, p = 0.03). The QRS duration decreased considerably from supine (92.8 ± 12.6 ms) to prone (84.9 ± 11.9 ms, p < 0.001). The mean QRS axis moved to the left in the prone posture (40.5° ± 32°) relative to the supine (49° ± 28°, p=0.015). The QRS amplitude in the precordial leads was significantly decreased from supine (7.42 ± 3.1 mV) to prone (3.68 ± 1.7 mV, p < 0.001). In addition, changes in the QRS morphology in leads V1–V3 with the appearance of new Q waves were noted. A notable variation in the mean corrected QT (QTc) period with decrease in duration in prone posture ECG (385 ± 64.8) relative to supine (406 ± 18.8, p=0.05).

g32idh44,WHO,Examining the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Delivery of HIV Care and Prevention Services Among Patients in a Ryan White Clinic,,unk,"Background We sought to characterize the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV-related outcomes in a cohort of patients by examining rates of viral load (VL) suppression, retention-in-care, PrEP access, and STIs. Methods This was a single center, retrospective study of adults receiving HIV treatment or HIV/STI prevention services from 01/2019 - 12/2020. HIV outpatient visits were identified through HRSA’s CareWARE. Visits (in-person, telehealth) only included HIV primary care. HRSA core performance measures were utilized (Table 1). STI positivity rates and descriptive characteristics were calculated. New and refill PrEP prescriptions were tabulated. Chi-square tests compared unmatched non-parametric variables;McNemar’s test matched non-parametric variables. Multivariable logistic regression identified variables associated with retention in care and viral suppression. Results 1721 patients received care;1234 were seen in both years, 334 only in 2019, 153 only in 2020. The number of telehealth visits increased significantly: video (0% to 31%, < 0.001), phone (0% to 0.4%, p < 0.001). Though the proportion of kept appointments increased (57.2% vs 61.2%), the annual retention in care rate decreased from 74.5% to 70.9% (p = 0.002). Overall, 9.7% of patients had detectable VLs at any point. Compared to 2019, a lower proportion of patients maintained VL suppression in 2020, (91.6% vs 83.5% p = 0.075). More patients did not have a VL drawn in 2020 than in 2019 (10.3% vs 2.0 %, p < 0.001). Patients with detectable VLs in 2019 were more likely than those who were undetectable to have detectable VLs in 2020 (OR 18.2, 95% CI 9.91-33.42). Black race was associated with higher likelihood of lack of VL suppression (OR = 2.0;95% CI 1.10-3.66). There were no significant differences between gender or age groups in rates of viral suppression, number screened for bacterial STIs or positive results. Visits for new and refill PrEP prescriptions decreased by 59% and 7%, respectively. Conclusion Rates of viral load suppression and retention in care decreased in 2020 compared to 2019. The proportion of clinic visits attended increased after the integration of telemedicine in 2020. These data may be used to inform evidence-based interventions to improve the HIV continuum of care through telehealth.

e226jmmu,Medline; PMC,Chimeric camel/human heavy-chain antibodies protect against MERS-CoV infection,10.1126/sciadv.aas9667,cc-by-nc,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) continues to cause outbreaks in humans as a result of spillover events from dromedaries. In contrast to humans, MERS-CoV–exposed dromedaries develop only very mild infections and exceptionally potent virus-neutralizing antibody responses. These strong antibody responses may be caused by affinity maturation as a result of repeated exposure to the virus or by the fact that dromedaries—apart from conventional antibodies—have relatively unique, heavy chain–only antibodies (HCAbs). These HCAbs are devoid of light chains and have long complementarity-determining regions with unique epitope binding properties, allowing them to recognize and bind with high affinity to epitopes not recognized by conventional antibodies. Through direct cloning and expression of the variable heavy chains (VHHs) of HCAbs from the bone marrow of MERS-CoV–infected dromedaries, we identified several MERS-CoV–specific VHHs or nanobodies. In vitro, these VHHs efficiently blocked virus entry at picomolar concentrations. The selected VHHs bind with exceptionally high affinity to the receptor binding domain of the viral spike protein. Furthermore, camel/human chimeric HCAbs—composed of the camel VHH linked to a human Fc domain lacking the CH1 exon—had an extended half-life in the serum and protected mice against a lethal MERS-CoV challenge. HCAbs represent a promising alternative strategy to develop novel interventions not only for MERS-CoV but also for other emerging pathogens.",2018-08-08,"Stalin Raj, V.; Okba, Nisreen M.

This study aims to determine the persistent symptoms and psychological conditions of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 15 months after onset. The potential risk factors were also explored.Methods: A cohort of COVID-19 patients discharged from February 20, 2020 to March 31, 2020 was recruited. Follow-ups were conducted using validated questionnaires and psychological screening scales at 15 months after onset to evaluate the patients’ health status. The risk factors for long-term health impacts and their associations with disease severity was analyzed.Findings: 534 COVID-19 patients were enrolled. The median age of the patients was 62.0 years old (IQR 52.0-70.0) and 295 were female (55.2%). The median time from onset to follow-up was 460.0 (451.0-467.0) days. Sleep disturbance (18.5%, 99/534) and fatigue (17.2%, 92/534) were the most common persistent symptoms. 6.4% (34/534) of the patients had depression, 9.2% (49/534) were anxious, 13.0% (70/534) had insomnia and 4.7% (25/534) suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Multivariate adjusted logistic regression analysis showed that glucocorticoid use during hospitalization (OR 3.58, 95% CI 1.12-11.44) was significantly associated with an increased risk of fatigue. The OR values for anxiety and sleep disorders were 2.36 (95% CI 1.07-5.20) and 2.16 (95% CI 1.13-4.14) in females compared with males. The OR value of PTSD was 25.6 (95% CI 3.3-198.4) in patients with persistent symptoms to those without persistent symptoms.

Survey data collected during the lockdown period have captured information about people’s ability to access green and blue spaces within urban BGI, inequalities in access, feelings, and values as well as needs and perceived pathways of future development of urban natural environment. In both cities, lockdowns limited access of people to green spaces which affected their mental and physical health. Survey results revealed that the quality, functionality, and location of open green spaces illustrated a disparity in distribution, meaning that in many cases several communities from particular neighborhoods suffered from limited access to BGI.

Healthcare sector in India was stretched to its limits and manual processes in place were prone to errors and time consuming. ICMR has taken initiative for data management and develop portal for tracking testing and positive cases. However, mechanisms are required to reduce double data entries from already resource constrain laboratories. There was need for a software for automated report dispatch and real time analysis based on artificial intelligence for timely dissemination of reports to patients and health authorities for prompt containment measures. Methods:Once the result for a specimen was concluded, lab facilities would enter test details into the ICMR’s portal. DAAP - Data Accumulation and Analysis Platform was designed to timely disseminate institution specific reports in en- crypted manner. Once the data is entered into the ICMR Portal, an excel is exported from the same which is uploaded to the DAAP. Every patient’s ingested data is verified by laboratory. Validated reports are published which can only be viewed by the respective collection centres from where a particular specimen was collected. The analytic dashboard provides cumulative real time data. Results:Prior to DAAP, data entry engaged 20 manhours per day to disseminate reports, which was reduced to less than two manhours due to DAAP. DAAP has not only reduced the challenges posed by the double data entry, confidentiality and security but also assisted in providing real time insights into the trends and laboratory quality systems. Conclusions:DAAP empowers the clinicians and the authorities to view data statistics real time. Data insights such as hospitalization rate, positivity rate, symptoms distribution and distribution based on various parameters like age group, gender, ward, district etc can be sought real time by DAAP.",,"Yadav, A.; Manchanda, V.; Tuteja, S.; Puri, D.; Saxena, S.",Indian Journal of Medical Microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmmb.2021.08.200,244277169.0,,296

Viral proteins have, therefore, evolved biological functions, such as signalling potential, that alter host cell physiology in ways that are still incompletely understood. Retroviral envelope glycoproteins interact with several host proteins, extracellularly with their cellular receptor and anti-envelope antibodies, and intracellularly with proteins of the cytoskeleton or sorting, endocytosis and recirculation pathways. Here, we examined the impact of endogenous retroviral envelope glycoprotein expression and interaction with host proteins, particularly antibodies, on the cell, independently of retroviral infection. We found that in the commonly used C57BL/6 substrains of mice, where murine leukaemia virus (MLV) envelope glycoproteins are expressed by several endogenous MLV proviruses, the highest expressed MLV envelope glycoprotein is under the control of an immune-responsive cellular promoter, thus linking MLV envelope glycoprotein expression with immune activation. We further showed that antibody ligation induces extensive internalisation from the plasma membrane into endocytic compartments of MLV envelope glycoproteins, which are not normally subject to constitutive endocytosis. Importantly, antibody binding and internalisation of MLV envelope glycoproteins initiates signalling cascades in envelope-expressing murine lymphocytic cell lines, leading to cellular activation. Similar effects were observed by MLV envelope glycoprotein ligation by its cellular receptor mCAT-1, and by overexpression in human lymphocytic cells, where it required an intact tyrosine-based YXXΦ motif in the envelope glycoprotein cytoplasmic tail. Together, these results suggest that signalling potential is a general property of retroviral envelope glycoproteins and, therefore, a target for intervention.",2020-05-26,"Panova, Veera; Attig, Jan; Young, George R.; Stoye, Jonathan P.; Kassiotis, George",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32453763/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1008605,218910844.0,2020.0,247

The maternal-fetal interface also successfully precludes transmission of most pathogens. This barrier function occurs in conjunction with a diverse influx of decidual immune cells including natural killer cells, macrophages and T cells. However, several viruses, among other microorganisms, manage to escape destruction by the host adaptive and innate immune system, leading to congenital infection and adverse pregnancy outcomes. In this review, we describe mechanisms of pathogenicity of two such viral pathogens, Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) at the maternal-fetal interface. Host decidual immune cell responses to these specific pathogens will be considered, along with their interactions with other cell types and the ways in which these immune cells may both facilitate and limit infection at different stages of pregnancy. Neither HCMV nor ZIKV naturally infect commonly used animal models [e.g., mice] which makes it challenging to understand disease pathogenesis.

It is the most frequent cause of acute liver failure in the majority of western countries and is a major cause of attrition of novel drug candidates. Manual trawling of literature for is the main route of deriving information on DILI from research studies. This makes it an inefficient process prone to human error. Therefore, an automatized AI model capable of retrieving DILI-related papers from the huge ocean of literature could be invaluable for the drug discovery community. In this project, we built an artificial intelligence (AI) model combining the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to address this problem. This model uses NLP to filter out meaningless text (e.g. stopwords) and uses customized functions to extract relevant keywords as singleton, pair, triplet and so on. These keywords are processed by apriori pattern mining algorithm to extract relevant patterns which are used to estimate initial weightings for a ML classifier. Along with pattern importance and frequency, an FDA-approved drug list mentioning DILI adds extra confidence in classification. The combined power of these methods build a DILI classifier (DILIC) with 94.91% cross-validation and 94.14% external validation accuracy.

However, the detection of one gene at high Cycle threshold (Ct) has to be interpreted with caution. In this study we address this specific issue and report our real-life experience. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 1639 nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) were analyzed with Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2. Positive samples showing high Ct values (Ct>35) were concentrated by centrifugation and re-tested with Cepheid or other methods (RealStar SARS-CoV2 RT-PCR, Altona Diagnostics; GeneFinder COVID-19 Plus RealAmp Kit, Elitech). RESULTS: 1599 (97.5%) negative samples, 36 (2.3%) positive samples and 4 (0.2%) presumptive positive samples were detected. In 17 out of 36 positive patients, very low viral RNA copies were suspected since positivity was detected at high Ct. We confirmed positivity for patients who showed both E and N genes detected and for patients with only N detected but with Ct <39. On the contrary, samples with only gene N detected with Ct values >39 were found negative. NPS taken 24 hours after the first collection confirmed the negativity of the 12 samples. Clinical data sustained these results since only 2 of these 12 patients showed COVID-19-like symptoms.

Evidence has shown increased mortality rates associated with COVID-19 infection. However, little is known about the outcomes of COVID-19 negative patients in a pandemic environment. In addition, the impact of vitamin D levels on mortality in COVID-19 hip fracture patients has yet to be determined. METHODS This multicentre observational study included 1,633 patients who sustained a hip fracture across nine hospital trusts in North West England. Data were collected for three months from March 2020 and for the same period in 2019. Patients were matched by Nottingham Hip Fracture Score (NHFS), hospital, and fracture type. We looked at the mortality outcomes of COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative patients sustaining a hip fracture. We also looked to see if Vitamin D levels had an impact on mortality. RESULTS The demographics of the 2019 and 2020 groups were similar, with a slight increase in proportion of male patients in the 2020 group. The 30-day mortality was 35.6% in COVID-19 positive patients and 7.8% in the COVID-19 negative patients. There was a potential association of decreasing vitamin D levels and increasing mortality rates for COVID-19 positive patients although our findings did not reach statistical significance.

Objective: To review immune changes brought along by each of these entities and how they might interrelate. Methods: We start presenting a brief review of the structure of the new coronavirus and how it alters the functioning of the human immune system. Subsequently, we describe the immune changes induced by AIT and how these changes could be favorable or unfavorable in the allergic patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a particular point of time during the evolving infection. Results: We describe how a healthy immune response against SARS-CoV-2 develops, versus an immune response that is initially suppressed by the virus, but ultimately overactivated, leading to an excessive production of cytokines (cytokine-storm-like). These changes are then linked to the clinical manifestations and outcomes of the patient. Reviewing the immune changes secondary to AIT, it becomes clear how AIT is capable of restoring a healthy innate immunity. Investigators have previously shown that the frequency of respiratory infections is reduced in allergic patients treated with AIT. On the other hand it also increases immunoregulation. Conclusion: As there are many variables involved, it is hard to predict how AIT could influence the allergic patient's reaction to a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In any case, AIT is likely to be beneficial for the patient with allergic rhinitis and/or allergic asthma in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic as controlling allergic diseases leads to a reduced need for contact with healthcare professionals. The authors remind the reader that everything in this article is still theoretical, since at the moment, there are no published clinical trials on the outcome of COVID-19 in allergic patients under AIT.",2021-05-01,"Larenas-Linnemann, Désirée E; Ortega-Martell, José A; Blandón-Vijil, María V; Rodríguez-Pérez, Noel; Luna-Pech, Jorge A; Estrada-Cardona, Alan; Arias-Cruz, Alfredo; Del Rio-Navarro, Blanca E; Rodríguez, Elsy M Navarrete; Pozo-Beltrán, Cesar F; Takane, Ernesto Onuma; Rojo-Gutiérrez, María I; Espinosa-Rosales, Francisco J; Martínez-Infante, Eric A",Allergy and asthma proceedings,https://doi.org/10.2500/aap.2021.42.210013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33980331/,234484683.0,2021.0,292

In particular, pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) stimulation has intrigued researchers since the 1970s. To date, many investigations have been carried out in vivo, but a gold standard treatment protocol has not yet been defined. The main obstacles are represented by the complex setting of PEMF characteristics, the variety of animal models (including direct and indirect bone damage) and the lack of a complete understanding of the molecular pathways involved. In the present review the main studies about PEMF stimulation in animal models with bone impairment were reviewed. PEMF signal characteristics were investigated, as well as their effect on molecular pathways and osseous morphological features. We believe that this review might be a useful starting point for a prospective study in a clinical setting. Consistent evidence from the literature suggests a potential beneficial role of PEMF in clinical practice. Nevertheless, the wide variability of selected parameters (frequency, duration, and amplitude) and the heterogeneity of applied protocols make it difficult to draw certain conclusions about PEMF effectiveness in clinical implementation to promote bone healing. Deepening the knowledge regarding the most consistent results reported in literature to date, we believe that this review may be a useful starting point to propose standardized experimental guidelines.

These studies find that the updated-vaccine does not induce higher titers to the vaccine-variant compared with the original-vaccine, suggesting that updating may not be needed. Our models recapitulate this observation but suggest that vaccination with the updated-vaccine generates qualitatively different humoral immunity, a small fraction of which is specific for unique epitopes to the new variant.

With no clinically approved drugs, the global health system is struggling to find an effective treatment measure. At this crucial juncture, screening of plant-derived compounds may be an effective strategy to combat COVID-19. The present study investigated the binding affinity of phytocompounds with 3-Chymotrypsin-like (3CLpro) and Papain-like proteases (PLpro) of SARS-CoV2 using in-silico techniques. A total of 32 anti-protease phytocompounds were investigated for the binding affinity to the proteins. Docking was performed in Autodock Vina. Pharmacophore descriptors of best ligands were studied using LigandScout. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of apo-protein and ligand-bound complexes was carried out in YASARA software. The druglikeness properties of phytocompounds were studied using ADMETlab. Out of 32 phytochemicals, amentoflavone and gallocatechin gallate showed the best binding affinity to 3CLpro (–9.4 kcal/mol) and PLpro (–8.8 kcal/mol). Phytochemicals such as savinin, theaflavin-3,3-digallate, and kazinol-A also showed strong affinity. MD simulation revealed ligand-induced conformational changes in the protein with decreased surface area and higher stability. The RMSD/F of proteins and ligands showed stability of the protein suggesting the effective binding of the ligand in both the proteins. Both amentoflavone and gallocatechin gallate possess promising druglikeness property. The present study thus suggests that Amentoflavone and Gallocatechin gallate may be potential inhibitors of 3CLpro and PLpro proteins and effective drug candidates for SARS-CoV2.

The extremely diverse roles of the nucleolar helicase DDX21, ranging from fundamental cellular processes such as cell growth, ribosome biogenesis, protein translation, protein–protein interaction, mediating and sensing transcription, and gene regulation to viral manipulation, drew our attention. We designed this project to study virus–host interactions and viral pathogenesis. A pulldown assay was used to investigate the association between foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) and DDX21. Further insight into the DDX21–FMDV interaction was obtained through dual-luciferase, knockdown, overexpression, qPCR, and confocal microscopy assays. Our results highlight the antagonistic feature of DDX21 against FMDV, as it progressively inhibited FMDV internal ribosome entry site (IRES) -dependent translation through association with FMDV IRES domains 2, 3, and 4. To subvert this host helicase antagonism, FMDV degraded DDX21 through its non-structural proteins 2B, 2C, and 3C protease (3C(pro)). Our results suggest that DDX21 is degraded during 2B and 2C overexpression and FMDV infection through the caspase pathway; however, DDX21 is degraded through the lysosomal pathway during 3C(pro) overexpression. Further investigation showed that DDX21 enhanced interferon-beta and interleukin-8 production to restrict viral replication. Together, our results demonstrate that DDX21 is a novel FMDV IRES trans-acting factor, which negatively regulates FMDV IRES-dependent translation and replication.",2021-09-03,"Abdullah, Sahibzada Waheed; Wu, Jin’en; Zhang, Yun; Bai, Manyuan; Guan, Junyong; Liu, Xiangtao; Sun, Shiqi; Guo, Huichen",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8473184/,,2021.0,215

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study reviewed the clinical and radiological evolution of 265 adult patients with COVID-19 attended at our center between March 2020 and April 2020. We recorded data related to patients' comorbidities, hospital stay, and clinical worsening (admission to the ICU, intubation, and death). We used three scoring systems taking into consideration 6 or 8 lung fields (designated 6A, 6B, and 8) to quantify lung involvement in each patient's initial abnormal chest X-ray and to classify its severity as mild, moderate, or severe, and we compared these three systems. We also recorded the presence of alveolar opacities and linear opacities (fundamentally linear atelectasis) in the first chest X-ray with pathologic findings. RESULTS: In the &#967;2 analysis, moderate or severe involvement in the three classification systems correlated with hospital admission (p=0.009 in 6A, p=0.001 in 6B, and p=0.001 in 8) and with death (p=0.02 in 6A, p=0.01 in 6B, and p=0.006 in 8). In the regression analysis, the most significant associations were 6B with alveolar involvement (OR 2.3; 95%CI 1.1.-4.7; p=0.025;) and 8 with alveolar involvement (OR 2.07; 95% CI 1.01.-4.25; p=0.046). No differences were observed in the ability of the three systems to predict clinical worsening by classifications of involvement in chest X-rays as moderate or severe. CONCLUSION: Moderate/severe extension in the three chest X-ray scoring systems evaluating the extent of involvement over 6 or 8 lung fields and the finding of alveolar opacities in the first abnormal X-ray correlated with mortality and the rate of hospitalization in the patients studied. No significant difference was found in the predictive ability of the three classification systems proposed.",,"Petite Felipe, D J; Rivera Campos, M I; San Miguel Espinosa, J; Malo Rubio, Y; Flores Quan, J C; Cuartero Revilla, M V",Unknown,,233215307.0,,309

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Teravolt cohort is an observational multicenter registry, including patients with non-small cell cancer, small cell cancer or mesothelioma but also epithelial tumors and a diagnosis of Covid-19. The Theravolt registry indicates an unexpectedly high mortality rate in patients with thoracic malignancies with COVID-19. RESULTS: Between March 26 and April 12, 2020, 200 patients treated in 8 countries were included. They had a performance status (PS) of 0-1 in 72% of cases, were smokers or ex-smokers in 81% of cases, had non-small cell cancer (76% of cases), were under treatment in 74% of cases, and the majority were first-line cases (57%). The hospitalization rate was 76% and the mortality rate 33%; only 10% of patients with criteria for intensive care hospitalization were admitted to the intensive care.

aehpaltd,WHO,Mouth Washing Impaired SARS-CoV-2 Detection in Saliva,10.20944/preprints202107.0145.v1,unk,"Background: A previous study demonstrated the performance of the Salivette®(SARSTEDT, Numbrecht, Germany) as a homogeneous saliva collection system to diagnose COVID-19 by RT-qPCR, notably for symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. However, for convalescent patients, the corroboration of molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 in paired nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and saliva samples was unsatisfactory. Objectives. The aim of the present work was to assess the concordance level of SARS-CoV-2 detection between paired sampling of NPSs and saliva collected with Salivette®at two time points, with ten days of interval. Results. A total of 319 paired samples from 145 outpatients (OP) and 51 healthcare workers (HW) were collected. Due to significant waiting rate at hospital, most of the patients ate and/or drank in waiting their turn. Consequently, a mouth washing was systematically proposed prior saliva collection. None of the HW were diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 positive using NPS or saliva specimens at both time points (n=95) by RT-qPCR. The virus was detected in 56.3% (n=126/224) of the NPS samples from OP, but solely 26.8% (n=60/224) of the paired saliva specimens. The detection of the internal cellular control, the human RNase P, in more than 98% of the saliva samples, underlined that the low sensitivity of saliva specimens (45.2%) for SARS-CoV-2 detection was not attributed to an improper saliva sample storing or RNA extraction. Conclusions. Then, the mouth washing decreased viral load of buccal cavity conducting to impairment of SARS-CoV-2 detection. Viral loads in saliva neo-produced appeared insufficient for molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2. At the time that saliva tests could be a rapid, simple and noninvasive strategy to assess on large scale schooled children in France, the determination of the performance of saliva collection become imperative to standardize procedures.",,"Costa, Monique Melo Benoit Nicolas Tissot-Dupont Hervé Million Matthieu Pradines Bruno Granjeaud Samuel Almeras Lionel",Unknown,https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202107.0145.v1,238845670.0,,280

In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effect of hyperthermia on bacterial swarming motility and antimicrobial resistance. METHODS Thirty-one P. mirabilis isolates were included in the study. Seven inoculated agar plates were incubated inside incubators with increasing temperature levels: at 36 °C (control) and 40-45 °C. On the next day, inhibition of swarming was evaluated and minimum paralyzing temperature (MPT) values were determined. An antimicrobial susceptibility test (antibiogram) is performed by exposing bacteria to increasing concentrations of antibiotics, in vitro. Thus, we used the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion test as a screening method to analyze the antibiogram profiles of the isolates at 36 °C and 42 °C. Finally, a time-kill assay was performed to analyze the killing effect of hyperthermia (42 °C) on planktonic bacteria, in combination with the antibiotic meropenem at the first and third hours. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare the killing effects of meropenem, hyperthermia and their combinations. RESULTS The median MPT value was determined as 44 °C. In the disk diffusion assay, susceptibility development was observed in 94% of isolates for at least one antibiotic. In the time-kill assay, we observed a significant killing effect of hyperthermia in combination with meropenem.

No information is currently available on the preservation of apheresis PLT in vitro quality parameters when PLTs are held at room temperature early in the storage period prior to transfer to cold storage. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Double units of platelets suspended in 35% plasma/65% PAS-III were collected from normal consenting research donors and rested at room temperature for 1-2 hours. One of the units was then stored at 1-6°C while the other unit was placed on an agitator at 20-24°C. Eight hours after collection, the unit stored at room temperature was transferred to 1-6°C storage without agitation. Units were sampled for an array of PLT in vitro parameters on Days 1, 7, 14, and 21. RESULTS As expected, PLTs held for 8 hours at 20-24°C prior to 1-6°C storage had greater lactate levels and reduced glucose levels and pH compared to PLTs subjected to a 1-2-hour room temperature hold prior to cold storage (P < .05). Unexpectedly, platelets held for 8 hours at room temperature had less aggregation response to collagen, ADP, and TRAP compared to PLTs held 1-2 hours at room temperature prior to cold storage (P < .05, n = 8).

Although telocytes can be found in many different tissues in luding the heart1, lung2 and intestine3, their tissue-specific roles are poorly understood. Here we identify a cell signalling role for telocytes in the periodontium whereby telocytes regulate macrophage activity. Methods We performed scRNA-seq and lineage tracing to identify TCs in mouse periodontium in homeostasis and periodontitis and carried out HGF signalling inhibition experiments using Tivantinib. Results We demonstrated that TCs are quiescent in homeostasis, however, they proliferate and serve as a major source of HGF in periodontitis. Macrophages receive telocyte-derived HGF signals and shift from an M1 to a M1/M2 hybrid state. Conclusions Our results reveal the source of HGF signals in periodontal tissue and provide new insights into the function of TCs in regulating macrophage behaviour in periodontitis through HGF/c-Met cell signalling, that may provide a novel approach in periodontitis treatment.

The hyaluronic acid receptors CD44 and the receptor for hyaluronan mediated motility (RHAMM, also known as HMMR and CD168), have been shown to be involved in the pathogeneses of both solid tumors and hematological malignancies. In an attempt to improve risk stratification, expression of RHAMM and CD44 were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and digital image analysis in pre-therapeutic tumor-tissue biopsies from FL patients, either without (nt-FL, n = 34), or with (st-FL, n = 31) subsequent transformation, and in paired biopsies from the transformed lymphomas (tFL, n = 31). At the time of initial diagnosis, samples from st-FL patients had a higher expression of RHAMM compared with samples from nt-FL patients (p < 0.001).

lez3cq0x,Medline; WHO,"Compassionate, collective or transformational nursing leadership to ensure fundamentals of care are achieved: A new challenge or non-sequitur?",10.1111/jan.15202,unk,"AIMS: This discursive paper draws on three key leadership theories with the aim of outlining how styles of leadership impact the provision of fundamentals of care. DESIGN: Discussion paper. DATA SOURCES: key leadership theories, leadership and fundamentals of care literature. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: The conceptualization of fundamentals of care is viewed through the lens of nursing leadership, and collective, compassionate and transformational leadership theory. The cognitive dissonance that nursing leaders encounter when trying to reconcile organizational, patient and nurses' needs is considered, and the pressure to deliver high-quality fundamentals of care presents a challenge to nurse leaders. CONCLUSION: Leaders must align nursing and patient outcome data to drive forward and prioritize fundamental care. Focusing on key elements of relational leadership styles will ensure a workforce fit to provide fundamental care, which in the current climate must be an organizational and global nursing priority. IMPACT: This discussion attempts to draw together overlapping leadership theories, emphasizes the importance of relational leadership in ensuring the provision of the fundamentals of care and acknowledged the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on nurses and nursing care, with leadership implications outlined, such as a need for role-modelling, understanding shared values and giving nurses a voice. It will have an impact on nurse leaders, but also on those nurses providing direct care by issuing a challenge for them to confront their own nurse leaders, and to ask that they better resolve competing needs of both the nursing workforce and patients.",,"Pattison, Natalie; Corser, Rachael",J. adv. nurs,https://doi.org/10.1111/jan.15202; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35301739/,247520557.0,,243

In the United States, inactivated and subunit PEDV vaccines for pregnant sows are available, but fail to induce sufficient protection in neonatal piglets farrowed from PEDV naïve sows. A safe and efficacious live attenuated vaccine that can prime mucosal immune responses is urgently needed. In this study, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of two attenuated PEDV vaccine candidates, the emerging non-S INDEL PEDV strain PC22A at the 100th cell culture passage level - Clone no. 4 (P100C4) and at the 120th passage level (P120), in weaned pigs. RESULTS: Four groups of 40-day-old weaned pigs were inoculated orally with PEDV PC22A-P3 (virulent), -P100C4, -P120, and mock, respectively, and challenged with the P3 virus at 24 days post-inoculation (dpi). After inoculation, P3 caused diarrhea in all pigs with a high level of fecal viral RNA shedding. P100C4 and P120 did not cause diarrhea in pigs, although viral RNA was detected in feces of all pigs, except for one P100C4-inoculated pig. Compared with the P120 group, P3- and P100C4-inoculated pigs had higher serum PEDV-specific IgG and viral neutralizing (VN) antibody (Ab) titers at 14 dpi. After the challenge, no pigs in the P3 group but all pigs in the P100C4, P120, and mock groups had diarrhea. Compared with the P120 group, pigs in the P100C4 group had a more rapid decline in fecal PEDV RNA shedding titers, higher titers of serum PEDV-specific IgG, IgA, and VN Abs, and higher numbers of intestinal IgA Ab-secreting cells. CONCLUSIONS: PEDV PC22A P100C4 and P120 were fully attenuated in weaned pigs but failed to elicit protection against virulent P3 challenge. P100C4 induced higher PEDV-specific antibody responses than P120 post inoculation resulting in a greater anamnestic response post challenge. Therefore, P100C4 potentially could be tested as a priming vaccine or be further modified using reverse genetics. It also can be administered in multiple doses or be combined with inactivated or subunit vaccines and adjuvants as a PEDV vaccination regimen, whose efficacy can be tested in the future.

We evaluated the clinical outcomes of methylprednisolone therapy (MPT) for patients with a high-risk common type(HRCT) COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: We conducted a multi-centre retrospective cohort study in northeast China. A comparison was performed between the standard treatment (SDT) group and the SDT+MPT group to determine the efficacy of methylprednisolone in treating HRCT COVID-19 pneumonia. Results: We collected the medical records of 403 patients with HRCT COVID-19 pneumonia (127 in the SDT+MPT group and 276 in the SDT group). None of the patients had received mechanical ventilation or died. Further, there had been no side-effects associated with of MPT. Patients in the SDT+MPT group treated with methylprednisolone received an intravenous injection for a median interval of five days (interquartile range of three to seven days). The trends in lymphocyte count, C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, lactic acid dehydrogenase, respiratory rate, SpO2, PaO2, D-dimer and body temperature were similar between the SDT+MPT and SDT groups. The results for the SDT+MPT group seems to be faster improved than the SDT group;however, the results were not statistically significant. Clinical outcomes revealed that the average hospitalisation days and the rate of progression to severe type COVID-19 pneumonia in both the SDT+MPT group and the SDT group were present in 14.56±0.57days vs 16.55±0.3days(p=0.0009) and 21.26%(27/127) vs 32.4%(89/276)(p=0.0254), respectively. The 16-day nucleic acid negative rate was higher in the SDT+MPT group than the SDT group, 81.73% (104/127) vs 65.27% (180/276) (p = 0.0014). Conclusions: MPT effectively prevents patients with HRCT COVID-19 pneumonia from progressing to the severe stage.

We have found that an intranasal Shigella vaccine (Invaplex) which is well tolerated in humans can also function as an adjuvant for intranasal protein and DNA vaccines in mice. To determine whether Invaplex could potentially adjuvant similar vaccines in humans, we simultaneously administered a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) envelope (Env) protein and DNA encoding simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) with or without Invaplex in the nasal cavity of female rhesus macaques. Animals were intranasally boosted with adenoviral vectors expressing SIV env or gag,pol to evaluate memory responses. Anti-SIV antibodies in sera and nasal, genital tract and rectal secretions were quantitated by ELISA. Intracellular cytokine staining was used to measure Th1-type T cells in blood. Macaques given DNA/protein immunizations with 0.5 mg Invaplex developed greater serum IgG, nasal IgA and cervicovaginal IgA responses to SIV Env and SHIV Gag,Pol proteins when compared to non-adjuvanted controls. Rectal IgA responses to Env were only briefly elevated and not observed to Gag,Pol. Invaplex increased frequencies of IFNγ-producing CD4 and CD8 T cells to the Env protein, but not T cell responses induced by the DNA. Ad-SIV boosting increased Env-specific polyfunctional T cells and Env- and Gag,Pol-specific antibodies in serum and all secretions. The data suggest that Invaplex could be highly effective as an adjuvant for intranasal protein vaccines in humans, especially those intended to prevent infections in the genital or respiratory tract.",2021-06-24,"Camp, Jeremy V.; Wilson, Robert L.; Singletary, Morgan; Blanchard, James L.; Aldovini, Anna; Kaminski, Robert W.; Oaks, Edwin V.; Kozlowski, Pamela A.",Vaccine X,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvacx.2021.100105; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34258576/,235811263.0,2021.0,252

ryrzmr4d,PMC,SmartMedChain: A Blockchain-Based Privacy-Preserving Smart Healthcare Framework,10.1155/2021/4145512,cc-by,"Nowadays, the adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) technology worldwide is accelerating the digital transformation of healthcare industry. In this context, smart healthcare (s-healthcare) solutions are ensuring better and innovative opportunities for healthcare providers to improve patients' care. However, these solutions raise also new challenges in terms of security and privacy due to the diversity of stakeholders, the centralized data management, and the resulting lack of trustworthiness, accountability, and control. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end Blockchain-based and privacy-preserving framework called SmartMedChain for data sharing in s-healthcare environment. The Blockchain is built on Hyperledger Fabric and stores encrypted health data by using the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a distributed data storage solution with high resiliency and scalability. Indeed, compared to other propositions and based on the concept of smart contracts, our solution combines both data access control and data usage auditing measures for both Medical IoT data and Electronic Health Records (EHRs) generated by s-healthcare services. In addition, s-healthcare stakeholders can be held accountable by introducing an innovative Privacy Agreement Management scheme that monitors the execution of the service in respect of patient preferences and in accordance with relevant privacy laws.

The spike glycoprotein (S) is a promising target for inducing immune responses and providing protection; thus the ongoing efforts for the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and therapeutic developments are mostly spiraling around S glycoprotein. The matured functional spike glycoprotein is presented on the virion surface as trimers, which contain two subunits, such as S1 (virus attachment) and S2 (virus fusion). The S1 subunit harbors the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the receptor-binding domain (RBD). The RBD is responsible for binding to host-cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The NTD and RBD of S1, and the S2 of S glycoprotein are the major structural moieties to design and develop spike-based vaccine candidates and therapeutics. Here, we have identified three novel epitopes (20-amino acid peptides) in the regions NTD, RBD, and S2 domains, respectively, by structural and immunoinformatic analysis. We have shown as a proof of principle in the murine model, the potential role of these novel epitopes in-inducing humoral and cellular immune responses. Further analysis has shown that RBD and S2 directed epitopes were able to efficiently inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 wild-type virus in vitro suggesting their role as virus entry inhibitors. Structural analysis revealed that S2-epitope is a part of the heptad repeat 2 (HR2) domain which might have plausible inhibitory effects on virus fusion.

For the patients who died, 9presented with underlying diseases,6 of whom had more than 2 diseases, which was significantly higher than the number of underlying disease in the other groups. On admission, the chest computed tomography (CT) for 8 patients (61.5%) mainly showed multiple patchy ground-glass opacities. When the disease progressed, the ground-glass opacities rapidly developed into diffuse lesions in both lungs. The lymphocyte and CD3 + ,CD4 + , and CD8 + T lymphocyte counts in the peripheral blood of 13 patients were significantly lower than normal levels and decreased more substantially during the disease course based on the levels when admitted (P<0.01). Additionally, the IL-6, D-dimer, C-reactive protein (CRP), lactic acid levels gradually increased, and most peaked before death. There were statistically significant differences in IL-6 expression, lymphocyte count and T lymphocyte subset count between the deceased group and the moderate group, severe group and critical group (P<0.01). However, there were no statistically significant differences in serum CRP lactic acid levels among the 4 groups (P>0.05).The cause of death for most patients was acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with type I respiratory failure. Three patients eventually developed multiorgan deficiency syndrome (MODS).Conclusion The risk factors of death for COVID-19 patients included older men, more underlying diseases, poor cellular immune function and overexpression of inflammatory factors. The main cause of death in patients with COVID-19 was ARDS, which led to respiratory failure and MODS.",,"Liu, Haichao Hu Zhenhong Mao Chongzheng Xu Ruijuan Zhang Fangqi Li Long Song Qing",Unknown,https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-21072/v1,235043416.0,,408
ognhpbsf,WHO,The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on gender-related work from home in STEM fields-Report of the WiMPBME Task Group,,unk,"The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many people, including those in the fields of science and engineering, to work from home. The new working environment caused by the pandemic is assumed to have a different impact on the amount of work that women and men can do from home. Particularly, if the major burden of child and other types of care is still predominantly on the shoulders of women. As such, a survey was conducted to assess the main issues that biomedical engineers, medical physicists (academics and professionals), and other similar professionals have been facing when working from home during the pandemic. A survey was created and disseminated worldwide. It originated from a committee of International Union for Physical and Engineering Sciences in Medicine (IUPESM; Women in Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering Task Group) and supported by the Union. The ethics clearance was received from Carleton University. The survey was deployed on the Survey Monkey platform and the results were analyzed using IBM SPSS software. The analyses mainly consisted of frequency of the demographic parameters and the cross-tabulation of gender with all relevant variables describing the impact of work at home. A total of 921 responses from biomedical professions in 76 countries were received: 339 males, 573 females, and nine prefer-not-to-say/other. Regarding marital/partnership status, 85% of males were married or in partnership, and 15% were single, whereas 72% of females were married or in partnership, and 26% were single. More women were working from home during the pandemic (68%) versus 50% of men. More men had access to an office at home (68%) versus 64% for women. The proportion of men spending more than 3 h on child care and schooling per day was 12%, while for women it was 22%; for household duties, 8% of men spent more than 3 h; for women, this was 12.5%. It is interesting to note that 44% of men spent between 1 and 3 h per day on household duties, while for women, it was 55%. The high number of survey responses can be considered excellent. It is interesting to note that men participate in childcare and household duties in a relatively high percentage; although this corresponds to less hours daily than for women. It is far more than can be found 2 and 3 decades ago. This may reflect the situation in the developed countries only-as majority of responses (75%) was received from these countries. It is evident that the burden of childcare and household duties will have a negative impact on the careers of women if the burden is not more similar for both sexes. It is important to recognize that a change in policies of organizations that hire them may be required to provide accommodation and compensation to minimize the negative impact on the professional status and career of men and women who work in STEM fields.",,"Frize, Monique; Lhotska, Lenka; Marcu, Loredana G; Stoeva, Magdalena; Barabino, Gilda; Ibrahim, Fatimah; Lim, Sierin; Kaldoudi, Eleni; Marques da Silva, Ana Maria; Tan, Peck Ha; Tsapaki, Virginia; Bezak, Eva","Gender, work and organization",,234806158.0,,476

However, ultrasonography (US) is not included in many mass screening programs, and people have limited access to it. The aim of this study is to validate the fatty liver index (FLI) and investigate the optimal cutoff value for predicting NAFLD in an asymptomatic population. We conducted a retrospective cohort study in Korea. All subjects who underwent health checkup exams, including abdominal US, controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) and blood testing, were enrolled. Analyses of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) were used to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and to calculate the optimal FLI cutoff for US-NAFLD. Among the 4009 subjects (mean age 54.9 years, 83.5% male), the prevalence of US-diagnosed NAFLD and CAP-defined hepatic steatosis was 61.4% and 55.4%. The previously used cutoff of FLI = 60 showed poor performance in predicting US-diagnosed NAFLD, with an AUROC of 0.63 (0.62-0.64), and CAP-defined NAFLD, with an AUROC 0.63 (0.62-0.64). The optimal FLI cutoff values to discriminate fatty liver detected by US were 29 for the entire population, with an AUROC of 0.82 (0.81-0.84). The sex-specific values were 31 for males and 18 for females (sensitivity 72.8% and 73.4%; specificity 74.2% and 85.0%, respectively). The FLI cutoff for US-diagnosed NAFLD can be set as 29 for the entire Korean population. Considering the sex dimorphism in NAFLD, different cutoff values are suggested to predict US-diagnosed NAFLD.

The authors investigate perception of change and adaptive consumer behaviour, as well as the tactical capabilities of luxury brands interested in expanding the market while maintaining a premium brand with its values and history. First of all, the market in the luxury segment is shown through the lens of changes that have arisen in consumer behaviour in connection with the development of digital technologies. Taking this factor into account, the authors study the reactions of consumer behaviour that appeared in the new pandemic reality, and with the use of statistics of search queries based on Google and Yandex data, they show how global trends are manifested in the Russian market. The study reveals that against the background of global trends in consumer behaviour there was a more significant adaptation of the Russian population to new conditions, and in some cases specificity of consumer behaviour manifested itself in the local market at different stages of the dynamics of coronavirus spread. Based on the analysis of new trends, recommendations are given on what technologies luxury brands can use in the conditions of pandemic decline in the Russian market to match consumer requests in new realities.

The arsenal of drugs available is limited, and prolonged use of such drugs makes parasite to become resistant. Therefore, it is very imperative to develop a safe, cost-effective and inexpensive vaccine against VL. Although in recent years many strategies have been pursued by researchers, but so far only some of the vaccine candidates reached for clinical trial and more than half of them are still in pipeline. There is now a broad consent among Leishmania researchers that the perseverance of parasite is very essential for eliciting a protective immune response and may perhaps be attained by live attenuated parasite vaccination. For making a live attenuated parasite it is very essential to ensure that the parasite is deficient of virulence and should further study genetically modified parasites to perceive the mechanism of pathogenesis.

Recent evidence indicates that the spectrum from TB infection to TB disease is much more complex, including a “continuum” of situations didactically reported as uninfected individual, TB infection, incipient TB, subclinical TB without signs/symptoms, subclinical TB with unrecognised signs/symptoms, and TB disease with signs/symptoms.

Despite its worldwide occurrence, little is known on the pathogenesis of HBoV infections. In addition, few systematic studies of HBoV in ARI have been conducted in Latin America. Therefore, in order to test whether active viral replication of human bocavirus is associated with respiratory diseases and to understand the clinical impact of this virus in patients with these diseases, we performed a 3-year retrospective hospital-based study of HBoV in outpatients and inpatients with symptoms of Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) in Brazil. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) from 1015 patients with respiratory symptoms were tested for HBoV DNA by PCR. All samples positive for HBoV were tested by PCR for all other respiratory viruses, had HBoV viral loads determined by quantitative real time PCR and, when possible, were tested by RT-PCR for HBoV VP1 mRNA, as evidence of active viral replication. HBoV was detected in 4.8% of patients, with annual rates of 10.0%, 3.0% and 3.0% in 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. The range of respiratory symptoms was similar between HBoV-positive and HBoV-negative ARI patients. However, a higher rate of diarrhea was observed in HBoV-positive patients. High HBoV viral loads (>10(8) copies/mL) and diarrhea were significantly more frequent in patients with exclusive infection by HBoV and in patients with detection of HBoV VP1 mRNA than in patients with viral co-infection, detected in 72.9% of patients with HBoV.

Although empirical research has demonstrated that these resources have promise, the available evidence for their benefit in women requires further investigation. Evidence supports the capacity of interventions that are sex-, gender-, and trauma-informed to improve treatment access and outcomes and to reduce health system challenges and disparities. Indeed, both sex- and gender-specific approaches are critical to improve health and gender equity. Violence and trauma are frequent among those with substance use concerns, but they disproportionately affect those who identify as female or women, further underscoring the need for trauma-informed care as well. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the evidence supporting the efficacy or effectiveness of online or mobile interventions for risky or harmful substance use in adults who identify as female or women, or who report a history of trauma. METHODS: This scoping review is based on an academic search in MEDLINE, APA PsycINFO, Embase, Cochrane Central, and CINAHL, as well as a grey literature search in US and Canadian government and funding agency websites. Of the 7807 records identified, 465 remained following title and abstract screening. Of these, 159 met all eligibility criteria and were reviewed and synthesized. RESULTS: The 159 records reflected 141 distinct studies and 125 distinct interventions. Investigations and the interventions evaluated predominantly focused on alcohol use or general substance use. Evaluated digital health resources included multisession and brief-session interventions, with a wide range of therapeutic elements. Multisession online and mobile interventions exhibited beneficial effects in 86.1% (105/122) of studies. Single-session interventions similarly demonstrated beneficial effects in 64.2% (43/67) of study conditions. Most investigations did not assess gender identity or conduct sex- or gender-based analyses. Only 13 investigations that included trauma were identified.

The archive set is generated from inferior solutions, removed from the main population, as the search process proceeds. Next, the archived solutions participate in the search during mutation step, allowing better exploration properties to be achieved. The LSHADE-RSP algorithm is taken as baseline, and 4 new update rules are proposed, including replacing the worst solution, the first found worse solution, the tournament-selected solution and individually stored solution for every solution in the population. The experiments are performed on CEC 2020 single objective optimization benchmark functions. The results are compared using statistical tests. The comparison shows that changing the update strategy significantly improves the performance of LSHADE-RSP on high-dimensional problems. The deeper analysis of the reasons of efficiency improvement reveals that new archive update strategies lead to more successful usage of the archive set.

This study reports the effect of the COVID-19 lockdown on appetite and overeating in Australian adults during the first month of emergency measures. DESIGN: This study reports analysis of data from the population-based, self-completed survey. The main outcome measure was an item from the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 asking: 'Over the past 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by poor appetite or overeating?'. Data on sociodemographic factors, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and the impact of COVID-19 and lockdown were also collected. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine associations with poor appetite or overeating. SETTING: An anonymous online survey available from 3 April to 2 May 2020. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 13 829 Australian residents aged 18 years or over. RESULTS: The weighted prevalence of being bothered by poor appetite or overeating in the past 2 weeks was 53·6 %, with 11·6 % (95 % CI 10·6, 12·6) of the cohort reporting poor appetite or overeating nearly every day. High levels of anxiety, concern about contracting COVID-19, being in lockdown with children and reporting a severe impact of the lockdown were associated with increased odds of poor appetite or overeating. CONCLUSIONS: Given the widespread prevalence of being bothered by poor appetite or overeating, universal public health interventions to address emotion-focused or situational eating during periods of lockdown may be appropriate.",,"Owen, A J; Tran, T; Hammarberg, K; Kirkman, M; Fisher, Jrw",Public Health Nutr,,221912579.0,,241

However, such reports are scarce. We sought to determine origins and factors associated with nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a 528-bed teaching hospital in Western New York. METHODS: The index patient, who had mental illness, wandered throughout the ward, would not wear a facemask, and was often kept seated at the nursing station, developed COVID-19 on day- 22 of hospitalization. A case-control approach was used, wherein all patients, staff, and 128 randomly selected environmental surfaces on the outbreak unit (case), and randomly selected patients, staff, and environmental surfaces on designated COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 units (control), were tested for SARS-COV-2 by RT-PCR and IgG SARS-COV-2 antibodies (SAR-Ab). Compliance with hand hygiene (HH) and COVID-specific personal protective equipment (PPE) was assessed. RESULTS: 145 staff and 26 patients were potentially exposed resulting in 25 secondary cases (14 staff and 11 patients). 4/14 (29%) of the staff and 7/11 (64%) of the patients who tested positive, and later became ill, were asymptomatic at the time of testing (Figures 1–2). There was no difference in mean cycle threshold for SARS-COV-2 gene targets between asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals. 0/32 randomly selected staff from the positive and negative control wards tested positive. PPE compliance based on 354 observations was not significantly different between wards. Environmental surface contamination with SARS-COV-2 RNA was not different between outbreak and control wards. Mean monthly HH compliance, based on 20,146 observations, was lower on the outbreak ward (p < 0.006) (Figure 3). 142 staff volunteered for serologic testing. The proportion staff with detectable SAR-Ab was higher on the outbreak ward (OR 3.78: CI 1.01–14.25).

Flow disruption with the WEB is a potentially interesting endovascular treatment for this type of aneurysm. OBJECTIVE To report in a multicenter series the preliminary treatment experience of MCA aneurysms with flow disruption by the WEB. METHODS Thirty-three patients with 34 MCA aneurysms were treated with the WEB in 5 European centers. The ability to successfully deploy the WEB, procedure- and device-related adverse events, morbidity and mortality of the treatment, and short-term angiographic follow-up results were analyzed. RESULTS Most treated aneurysms were unruptured (85.3%) and were between 5 and 10 mm (85.3%) with a neck size ≥ 4 mm (88.2%). The treatment failed in 1 of the 34 aneurysms (2.9%) owing to a lack of appropriate device size. Treatment was performed exclusively with the WEB in 29 of 33 aneurysms (87.9%). Additional treatment (coiling and/or stenting) was used in 4 of 33 aneurysms (12.1%). Mortality of the treatment was 0.0% and morbidity was 3.1% (intraoperative rupture with modified Rankin Scale score of 3 at the 1-month follow-up). In short-term follow-up (range, 2-12 months), adequate occlusion (total occlusion or neck remnant) was observed in 83.3% of aneurysms.

Public debate has since centered on whether the official statistics are failing to capture the actual vaccination coverage. The authors argue that the topic of one’s COVID-19 vaccination status is sensitive in times of a pandemic and that estimates based on surveys are biased by social desirability. The authors investigate this conjecture using an experimental method called the item count technique, which provides respondents with the opportunity to answer in an anonymous setting. Estimates obtained using the item count technique are compared with those obtained using the conventional method of asking directly. Results show that social desirability bias leads some unvaccinated individuals to claim they are vaccinated. Conventional survey studies thus likely overestimate vaccination coverage because of misreporting by survey respondents. © The Author(s) 2022.",,"Wolter, F.; Mayerl, J.; Andersen, H.

pqwd044z,Medline; PMC; WHO,Reimagining the Clinical Competency Committee to Enhance Education and Prepare for Competency-Based Time-Variable Advancement,10.1007/s11606-022-07515-3,cc-by,"Assessing residents and clinical fellows is a high-stakes activity. Effective assessment is important throughout training so that identified areas of strength and weakness can guide educational planning to optimize outcomes. Assessment has historically been underemphasized although medical education oversight organizations have strengthened requirements in recent years. Growing acceptance of competency-based medical education and its logical extension to competency-based time-variable (CB-TV) graduate medical education (GME) further highlights the importance of implementing effective evidence-based approaches to assessment. The Clinical Competency Committee (CCC) has emerged as a key programmatic structure in graduate medical education. In the context of launching a multi-specialty pilot of CB-TV GME in our health system, we have examined several program’s CCC processes and reviewed the relevant literature to propose enhancements to CCCs. We recommend that all CCCs fulfill three core goals, regularly applied to every GME trainee: (1) discern and describe the resident’s developmental status to individualize education, (2) determine readiness for unsupervised practice, and (3) foster self-assessment ability. We integrate the literature and observations from GME program CCCs in our institutions to evaluate how current CCC processes support or undermine these goals. Obstacles and key enablers are identified. Finally, we recommend ways to achieve the stated goals, including the following: (1) assess and promote the development of competency in all trainees, not just outliers, through a shared model of assessment and competency-based advancement; (2) strengthen CCC assessment processes to determine trainee readiness for independent practice; and (3) promote trainee reflection and informed self-assessment. The importance of coaching for competency, robust workplace-based assessments, feedback, and co-production of individualized learning plans are emphasized. Individual programs and their CCCs must strengthen assessment tools and frameworks to realize the potential of competency-oriented education.",2022-04-20,"Goldhamer, Mary Ellen J.; Martinez-Lage, Maria; Black-Schaffer, W.

Acceptability and preferences regarding electronic monitoring (EM) systems to assess all three phases of medication adherence (ie, initiation, implementation, persistence) are crucial to allow their successful implementation in clinical or research settings but have not yet been evaluated. We therefore aimed to explore: 1) alloSCT patients’ medication adherence and self-management strategies; and 2) their acceptability and preferences of three different EM systems (MEMS Cap, Helping Hand, Button) as part of the Swiss SMILe study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Respecting anti-pandemic measures, we used a purposive sample of six adult alloSCT patients from the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland (USB)—6 weeks to 2 years post-alloSCT—to conduct three focus group sessions with two patients each. Using a semi-structured outline, we explored 1) patients’ medication adherence strategies and medication self-management; and 2) their acceptance and preferences regarding EM use. The three tested EM systems were available for testing during each session. Discussions were audio-recorded, visualized using mind-mapping and analyzed using Mayring’s qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Patients (33% females; mean age 54.6±16.3 years; 10.4±8.4 months post-alloSCT) used medication adherence enhancing strategies (eg, preparing pillbox, linking intake to a habit). Still, they indicated that post-alloSCT medication management was challenging (eg, frequent schedule changes). All participants preferred the MEMS Button. Participants said its small size and the possibility to combine it with existing pillboxes (eg, putting it into/next to them) made them more confident about implementing it in their daily lives. CONCLUSION: Regarding EM systems for medication adherence, end-user preferences and acceptability influence adoption and fidelity. Of the three systems tested, our sample found the MEMS Button most acceptable and most preferable. Therefore, we will use it for our USB SMILe study.",2022-01-06,"Ribaut, Janette; De Geest, Sabina; Leppla, Lynn; Gerull, Sabine; Teynor, Alexandra; Valenta, Sabine",Patient Prefer Adherence,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8747798/,,2022.0,288

Some recovered patients complain of continued shortness of breath. Vasculopathy has been reported in COVID-19, stressing the importance of probing microstructure and function of lungs at the alveolar-capillary interface. While CT detects structural abnormalities, little is known about the impact of disease on lung function. 129Xe MRI is a technique uniquely capable of assessing ventilation, microstructure and gas exchange. Using 129Xe MRI, we found COVID-19 patients have higher ventilation defects percentage (5.9% vs 3.7%), unchanged microstructure, longer gas-blood exchange time (43.5 ms vs 32.5 ms), and reduced RBC/TP (0.279 vs 0.330) compared with healthy subjects. These findings suggest regional ventilation and alveolar airspace dimensions are relatively normal around the time of discharge, while gas-blood exchange function is diminished. This study establishes the feasibility of localized lung function measurement in COVID-19 patients.

However, for patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery (EAS), the effect of inter-hospital transfer on outcomes is largely unknown. METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective observational study. Outcomes of transferred patients undergoing EAS were compared to patients primarily admitted to a tertiary care hospital from 01/2016 to 12/2018 using univariable and multivariable analyses. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Some 973 patients with a median (IQR) age of 58.1 (39.4–72.2) years and a median body mass index of 25.8 (22.5–29.3) kg/m(2) were included. The transfer group comprised 258 (26.3%) individuals and the non-transfer group 715 (72.7%). The population was stratified in three subgroups: (1) patients with low surgical stress (n = 483, 49.6%), (2) with hollow viscus perforation (n = 188, 19.3%) and (3) with potential bowel ischemia (n = 302, 31.1%). Neither in the low surgical stress nor in the hollow viscus perforation group was the transfer status associated with mortality. However, in the potential bowel ischemia group inter-hospital transfer was a predictor for mortality (OR 3.54, 95%CI 1.03–12.12, p = 0.045). Moreover, in the hollow viscus perforation group inter-hospital transfer was a predictor for reduced hospital length of stay (RC -10.02, 95%CI −18.14/−1.90, p = 0.016) and reduced severe complications (OR 0.38, 95%CI 0.18–0.77, p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: Other than in patients with low surgical stress or hollow viscus perforation, in patients with potential bowel ischemia inter-hospital transfer was an independent predictor for higher mortality. Taking into account the time sensitiveness of bowel ischemia, efforts should be made to avoid inter-hospital transfer in this vulnerable subgroup of patients.",2021-05-31,"Lavanchy, Joël L.; Dubuis, Jean-Baptiste; Osterwalder, Alice; Winterhalder, Sebastian; Haltmeier, Tobias; Candinas, Daniel; Schnüriger, Beat",World J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8166360/,,2021.0,273

xw58obqi,WHO,Association of In-Ear Device Use With Communication Quality Among Individuals Wearing Personal Protective Equipment in a Simulated Operating Room,,unk,"Importance: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought forth new challenges for health care workers, such as the daily use of personal protective equipment, including reusable facial respirators. Poor communication while wearing respirators may have fatal complications for patients, and no solution has been proposed to date. Objective: To examine whether use of an in-ear communication device is associated with improved communication while wearing different personal protective equipment (N95 mask, half-face elastomeric respirator, and powered air-purifying respirator [PAPR]) in the operating room. Design, Setting, and Participants: This quality improvement study was conducted in June 2020. Surgical residents from the Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, were recruited. All participants had normal hearing, were fluent in English, and had access to the operating rooms at the Royal Victoria Hospital. Exposures: All participants performed the speech intelligibility tasks with and without an in-ear communication device. Main Outcomes and Measures: Speech intelligibility was measured using a word recognition task (Modified Rhyme Test) and a sentence recognition task (AzBio Sentence Test). A percentage correct score (0% to 100%) was obtained for each speech intelligibility test. Listening effort was assessed using the NASA Task Load Index. An overall workload score, ranging from 0 points (low workload) to 100 points (high workload), was obtained. Results: A total of 12 participants were included (mean [SD] age, 31.2 [1.9] years; 8 women [66.7%]). AzBio Sentence Test results revealed that, while wearing the N95 mask, the mean (SD) speech intelligibility was 98.8% (1.8%) without the in-ear device vs 94.3% (7.4%) with the device. While wearing the half-face elastomeric respirator, the mean speech intelligibility was 58.5% (12.4%) without the in-ear device vs 90.8% (8.9%) with the device. While wearing the PAPR, the mean speech intelligibility was 84.6% (9.8%) without the in-ear device vs 94.5% (5.5%) with the device. Use of the in-ear device was associated with a significant improvement in speech intelligibility while wearing the half-face elastomeric respirator (32.3%; 95% CI, 23.8%-40.7%; P < .001) and the PAPR (9.9%; 95% CI, 1.4%-18.3%; P = .01). Furthermore, use of the device was associated with decreased listening effort. The NASA Task Load Index results reveal that, while wearing the N95 mask, the mean (SD) overall workload score was 12.6 (10.6) points without the in-ear device vs 17.6 (9.2) points with the device. While wearing the half-face elastomeric respirator, the mean overall workload score was 67.7 (21.6) points without the in-ear device vs 29.3 (14.4) points with the in-ear device. While wearing the PAPR, the mean overall workload score was 42.2 (18.2) points without the in-ear device vs 23.8 (12.8) points with the in-ear device. Use of the in-ear device was associated with a significant decrease in overall workload score while wearing the half-face elastomeric respirator (38.4; 95% CI, 23.5-53.3; P < .001) and the PAPR (18.4; 95% CI, 0.4-36.4; P = .04). Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that among participants using facial respirators that impaired communication, a novel in-ear device was associated with improved communication and decreased listening effort. Such a device may be a feasible solution for protecting health care workers in the operating room while allowing them to communicate safely, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.",,"Nguyen, Don Luong; Kay-Rivest, Emily; Tewfik, Marc A; Hier, Michael; Lehmann, Alexandre",JAMA Netw Open,,233298760.0,,531

However, there is a dearth of literature exploring family experiences of—or concerns related to—childhood vaccinations that gives voice to vaccine hesitant caregivers (VHCs) of small children. Here, we present insights from VHCs from the Philippines. METHODS: This research draws on in-depth interviews (IDIs) with 44 VHCs who had previously delayed or refused vaccination for their children in rural and urban communities in Cavite Province, the Philippines. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted IDIs via an online platform of the respondents’ choosing (ie, Facebook messenger call, Skype and Zoom). All interviews were recorded, transcribed, translated and analysed drawing from the tenets of constructivist grounded theory. We use the social ecological model to structure our results. RESULTS: Among the reasons for delay or refusal of childhood vaccinations, a fear of side effects emerged as the most salient concern, exacerbated by previous negative experiences (including trauma) from a dengue vaccine controversy in 2017. Respondents cited the dengue vaccine controversy as they expressed reluctance (regarding any new vaccines) and suspicion (towards school-based vaccination, the distribution channel used for the dengue vaccine). Heads of households opposing vaccines, perceptions that vaccines are non-essential and influences from the social and traditional media or neighbours contributed to further refusal and delay. Upon probing, VHCs recounted health system concerns particularly with regards to healthcare workers who are sometimes unable to answer their questions and can be dismissive or disrespectful regarding caregivers’ concerns.

Despite this, there is no evidence that horizontal equity, with respect to income, was violated for NHS hospital outpatient and inpatient care during the first wave of the pandemic. There is evidence of pro-rich inequities in access to GP consultations, prescriptions and medical helplines at the peak of the first wave, but these were eliminated as the pandemic progressed.

Manually generating a high-quality layout using this representation is labor-intensive. In this paper, we provide an automatic polygon layout generation algorithm for the visualization of N-ary relationships. At the core of our algorithm is a set of objective functions motivated by a number of design principles that we have identified. These objective functions are then used in an optimization framework that we develop to achieve high-quality layouts. Recognizing the duality between entities and relationships in the data, we provide a second visualization in which the roles of entities and relationships in the original data are reversed. This can lead to additional insight about the data. Furthermore, we enhance our framework for a joint optimization on the primal layout (original data) and the dual layout (where the roles of entities and relationships are reversed).

However, there are relatively few studies on the relationship between pain acceptance and opioid misuse in chronic pain patients. Thus, the aim of the present study was to test a hypothetical model in which pain acceptance would regulate pain sensations and pain-related thoughts and emotions, which would be related to opioid misuse. The sample comprised 140 chronic pain patients attending two hospitals. All patients were receiving pharmacological treatment, including opioid analgesics. Structural equation modelling analyses showed a significant association between higher pain acceptance and lower pain intensity and catastrophizing, and lower levels of anxiety and depression. Only higher anxiety and depression were significantly associated with increased opioid misuse. The results suggest that levels of anxiety, depression, and pain acceptance must be assessed before opioids are prescribed. Pain acceptance implies a relationship with internal events that protects against anxiety and depression and thus against opioid misuse.

RANDOMISATION: Randomisation (with a 1:1 randomisation ratio) will be centrally performed by using a secure, web-based system, which will be developed by the Methodological and Statistical Unit at the Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria of Modena. Randomisation stratified by 4 factors: 1) Gender (M/F); 2) Age (<75/&#8805;75 years); 3) BMI (<30/&#8805;30); 4) Comorbidities (0-1/>2) with random variable block sizes will be generated by STATA software. The web-based system will guarantee the allocation concealment. Blinding (masking) The study is conceived as open-label: patients and all health-care personnel involved in the study will be aware of the assigned group. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The target sample size is based on the hypothesis that LMWH administered at high doses versus low doses will significantly reduce the risk of clinical worsening. The overall sample size in this study is expected to be 300 with 150 in the Low-Dose LMWH control group and 150 in the High-Dose LMWH intervention group, recruited over 10-11 months. Assuming an alpha of 5% (two tailed) and a percentage of patients who experience clinical worsening in the control group being between 25% and 30%, the study will have 80% power to detect at least 50% relative reduction in the risk of death between low and high doses of heparin.

Its goal is to present a previously neglected approach to non-adaptive group testing and describes it in terms of residuated pairs on partially ordered sets. Our investigation has the advantage, as it naturally yields an efficient decision scheme (decoder) for any given testing scheme. This decoder allows to detect a large amount of infection patterns. Apart from this, we devise a construction of good group testing schemes that are based on incidence matrices of finite partial linear spaces. The key idea is to exploit the structure of these matrices and make them available as test matrices for group testing. These matrices may generally be tailored for different estimated disease prevalence levels. As an example, we discuss the group testing schemes based on generalized quadrangles.

They allow people to identify individuals, understand conversational cues, and make judgements about others’ mental states. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit the United States, widespread mask-wearing practices were implemented, causing a shift in the way Americans typically interact. This introduction of masks into social exchanges posed a potential challenge—how would people make these important inferences about others when a large source of information was no longer available? We conducted two studies that investigated the impact of mask exposure on emotion perception. In particular, we measured how participants used facial landmarks (visual cues) and the expressed valence and arousal (affective cues), to make similarity judgements about pairs of emotion faces. Study 1 found that in August 2020, participants with higher levels of mask exposure used cues from the eyes to a greater extent when judging emotion similarity than participants with less mask exposure. Study 2 measured participants’ emotion perception in both April and September 2020 –before and after widespread mask adoption—in the same group of participants to examine changes in the use of facial cues over time. Results revealed an overall increase in the use of visual cues from April to September. Further, as mask exposure increased, people with the most social interaction showed the largest increase in the use of visual facial cues. These results provide evidence that a shift has occurred in how people process faces such that the more people are interacting with others that are wearing masks, the more they have learned to focus on visual cues from the eye area of the face.",2021-10-12,"Barrick, Elyssa M.; Thornton, Mark A.; Tamir, Diana I.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34637454/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0258470,238741815.0,2021.0,271

Here we analyzed the degree to which Omicron pseudovirus evades neutralization by serum or therapeutic antibodies. Serum samples obtained 3 months after two doses of BNT162b2 vaccination exhibited 18-fold lower neutralization titers against Omicron than parental virus. Convalescent serum samples from individuals infected with the Alpha and Delta variants allowed similar frequencies of Omicron breakthrough infections. Domain-wise analysis using chimeric spike proteins revealed that this efficient evasion was primarily achieved by mutations clustered in the receptor-binding domain, but that multiple mutations in the N-terminal domain contributed as well. Omicron escaped a therapeutic cocktail of imdevimab and casirivimab, whereas sotrovimab, which targets a conserved region to avoid viral mutation, remains effective. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) decoys are another virus-neutralizing drug modality that are free, at least in theory, from complete escape. Deep mutational analysis demonstrated that, indeed, an engineered ACE2 molecule prevented escape for each single-residue mutation in the receptor-binding domain, similar to immunized serum. Engineered ACE2 neutralized Omicron comparably to the Wuhan strain and also showed a therapeutic effect against Omicron infection in hamsters and human ACE2 transgenic mice.

Data included 1136 SARS-2-CoV infections of the rural outbreak in Hebei, China, and 135 infections of the urban outbreak in Tianjin, China. We reconstructed SARS-CoV-2 transmission chains and analyzed the effectiveness of vaccination and NPIs by simulation studies. The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 showed strong heterogeneity in urban and rural areas, with the dispersion parameters k = 0.14 and 0.35, respectively (k < 1 indicating strong heterogeneity). Although age group and contact-type distributions significantly differed between urban and rural areas, the average reproductive number (R) and k did not. Further, simulation results based on pre-control parameters (R = 0.81, k = 0.27) showed that in the vaccination scenario (80% efficacy and 55% coverage), the cumulative secondary infections will be reduced by more than half; however, NPIs are more effective than vaccinating 65% of the population.

RESULTS: Relative to baseline data from mid February 2020, cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses demonstrated that average sleep quality was unchanged, or even improved, early in the pandemic. However, there were clear individual differences: approximately 25% of participants reported that their sleep quality had worsened, which was explained by stress vulnerability, caregiving, adverse life impact, shift work, and presence of COVID-19 symptoms.

5sqt6tqu,WHO,Phospholipid Arachidonic Acid Remodeling During Phagocytosis in Mouse Peritoneal Macrophages,,unk,"Macrophages contain large amounts of arachidonic acid (AA), which distributes differentially across membrane phospholipids. This is largely due to the action of coenzyme A-independent transacylase (CoA-IT), which transfers the AA primarily from diacyl choline-containing phospholipids to ethanolamine-containing phospholipids. In this work we have comparatively analyzed glycerophospholipid changes leading to AA mobilization in mouse peritoneal macrophages responding to either zymosan or serum-opsonized zymosan (OpZ). These two phagocytic stimuli promote the cytosolic phospholipase A2-dependent mobilization of AA by activating distinct surface receptors. Application of mass spectrometry-based lipid profiling to identify changes in AA-containing phospholipids during macrophage exposure to both stimuli revealed significant decreases in the levels of all major choline phospholipid molecular species and a major phosphatidylinositol species. Importantly, while no changes in ethanolamine phospholipid species were detected on stimulation with zymosan, significant decreases in these species were observed when OpZ was used. Analyses of CoA-IT-mediated AA remodeling revealed that the process occurred faster in the zymosan-stimulated cells compared with OpZ-stimulated cells. Pharmacological inhibition of CoA-IT strongly blunted AA release in response to zymosan but had only a moderate effect on the OpZ-mediated response. These results suggest a hitherto undescribed receptor-dependent role for CoA-independent AA remodeling reactions in modulating the eicosanoid biosynthetic response of macrophages. Our data help define novel targets within the AA remodeling pathway with potential use to control lipid mediator formation.",,"Gil-de-Gómez, Luis; Monge, Patricia; Rodríguez, Juan P; Astudillo, Alma M; Balboa, María A; Balsinde, Jesús",Unknown,,221076099.0,,222

Sensitivity analysis-by excluding data from Lombardy-partitioned the remaining regions into four clusters. Although cluster 1 (i.e. Veneto) and 2 (i.e. Piedmont and Emilia-Romagna) included the most hit regions beyond Lombardy, this partition reflected differences in the efficacy of restrictions and testing strategies.

whby0wjk,WHO,COVID-19 cases in US counties: roles of racial/ethnic density and residential segregation,,unk,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate how racial/ethnic density and residential segregation shape the uneven burden of COVID-19 in US counties and whether (if yes, how) residential segregation moderates the association between racial/ethnic density and infections. DESIGN: We first merge various risk factors from federal agencies (e.g. Census Bureau and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) with COVID-19 cases as of June 13th in contiguous US counties (N = 3,042). We then apply negative binomial regression to the county-level dataset to test three interrelated research hypotheses and the moderating role of residential segregation is presented with a figure. RESULTS: Several key results are obtained. (1) Counties with high racial/ethnic density of minority groups experience more confirmed cases than those with low levels of density. (2) High levels of residential segregation between whites and non-whites increase the number of COVID-19 infections in a county, net of other risk factors. (3) The relationship between racial/ethnic density and COVID-19 infections is enhanced with the increase in residential segregation between whites and non-whites in a county. CONCLUSIONS: The pre-existing social structure like residential segregation may facilitate the spread of COVID-19 and aggravate racial/ethnic health disparities in infections. Minorities are disproportionately affected by the novel coronavirus and focusing on pre-existing social structures and discrimination in housing market may narrow the uneven burden across racial/ethnic groups.",,"Yang, Tse-Chuan; Emily Choi, Seung-Won; Sun, Feinuo",Ethn Health,,222827726.0,,217

Few data are available about severe maternal morbidity (SMM) of these extremely preterm cesarean. The objective was to determine whether gestational age under 26 weeks of gestation (weeks) was associated with an increased risk of SMM compared with gestational age between 26 and 34 weeks in women having a cesarean delivery. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, ISI Web of Science, the Cochrane Database, PROSPERO, and ClinicalTrials.gov on January 31, 2020. The search strategy clustered terms describing SMM and preterm cesarean delivery. No restrictions on language, publication status, and study design were applied. Abstracts were included if there was sufficient information to assess study quality. The authors of all identified studies were contacted to request for aggregated data. Relative risks (RR) were calculated using the inverse variance method. The primary outcome was SMM as defined in each study. We analyzed data on preterm cesarean deliveries between 22 and 34 weeks. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (registration: CRD42019128644). RESULTS: Six studies involving 45,572 women (3,440 delivering < 26 weeks; 42,132 delivering between 26 and 34 weeks) were included. SMM occurred in 607 women (17.6 %) < 26 weeks and 4,483 women (10.6 %) between 26 and 34 weeks. Gestational age < 26 weeks was associated with an increased risk of SMM (RR, 1.65; 95 % CI [Confidence Interval], 1.52-1.78; I2 = 40 %). Gestational age < 26 weeks remained associated with SMM in the subgroup analyses depending on the type of the study (prospective or retrospective), country of the study (European or non-European), and high quality of the study. A sensitivity analysis showed that gestational age < 25 weeks was also associated with SMM in preterm cesarean delivery (RR, 1.66; 95 % CI, 1.50-1.83; I2 = 3%). CONCLUSIONS: Gestational age < 26 weeks was associated with an increased risk of SMM in women having a preterm cesarean delivery.

The emphasis on immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has led to many trials in this setting, with disappointing results until now. Therefore, we discuss the immunobiology of PCa, presenting ongoing trials and the available clinical data, to understand if immunotherapy could represent a valid option in this disease, and which subset of patients may be more likely to benefit. Current evidence suggests that the tumor microenvironment needs a qualitative rather than quantitative evaluation, along with the genomic determinants of prostate tumor cells. The prognostic or predictive value of immunotherapy biomarkers, such as PD-L1, TMB, or dMMR/MSI-high, needs further evaluation in PCa. Monotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has been modestly effective. In contrast, combined strategies with other standard treatments (hormonal agents, chemotherapy, PARP inhibitors, radium-223, and TKIs) have shown some results. Immunotherapy should be better investigated in biomarker-selected patients, particularly with specific pathway aberrations (e.g., AR-V7 variant, HRD, CDK12 inactivated tumors, MSI-high tumors).

4wswowcq,WHO,Requirements for Energy-Harvesting-Driven Edge Devices Using Task-Offloading Approaches,10.3390/electronics11030383,unk,"Energy limitations remain a key concern in the development of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices since most of them have limited energy sources, mainly from batteries. Therefore, providing a sustainable and autonomous power supply is essential as it allows continuous energy sensing, flexible positioning, less human intervention, and easy maintenance. In the last few years, extensive investigations have been conducted to develop energy-autonomous systems for the IoMT by implementing energy-harvesting (EH) technologies as a feasible and economically practical alternative to batteries. To this end, various EH-solutions have been developed for wearables to enhance power extraction efficiency, such as integrating resonant energy extraction circuits such as SSHI, S-SSHI, and P-SSHI connected to common energy-storage units to maintain a stable output for charge loads. These circuits enable an increase in the harvested power by 174% compared to the SEH circuit. Although IoMT devices are becoming increasingly powerful and more affordable, some tasks, such as machine-learning algorithms, still require intensive computational resources, leading to higher energy consumption. Offloading computing-intensive tasks from resource-limited user devices to resource-rich fog or cloud layers can effectively address these issues and manage energy consumption. Reinforcement learning, in particular, employs the Q-algorithm, which is an efficient technique for hardware implementation, as well as offloading tasks from wearables to edge devices. For example, the lowest reported power consumption using FPGA technology is 37 mW. Furthermore, the communication cost from wearables to fog devices should not offset the energy savings gained from task migration. This paper provides a comprehensive review of joint energy-harvesting technologies and computation-offloading strategies for the IoMT. Moreover, power supply strategies for wearables, energy-storage techniques, and hardware implementation of the task migration were provided.",,"Meriam Ben, Ammar Imed Ben Dhaou Dhouha El Houssaini Sahnoun Salwa Fakhfakh Ahmed Kanoun Olfa",Electronics,https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics11030383,246394598.0,,277

Risk models, public health experts and political leadership alike have given almost no attention to related, anticipated, and predictable societal and health impacts likely to result from behavioral responses to Covid-19 combined with the application of NPIs. Methods: This analysis demonstrates a standard risk assessment approach to quantify the impacts of Covid-19 unemployment in the United States on suicide and all cause mortality. Results: Applying observational epidemiological data to the population recently unemployed predicts 7444 deaths from suicide in the coming year and 556,000 avoidable deaths from all causes over the next ten years.

METHODS: This was a proof-of-concept study from a tertiary eye care center in Oakville, Canada. All participants underwent the N95 Qualitative Fit Test with a custom mask fitter secured over an American Society for Testing and Materials Level 3 face mask. Participants answered a 10-point Likert scale questionnaire on comfort, ease of use, and feasibility of the custom mask fitter, as well as comfort of a regular face mask. RESULTS: Twenty participants were recruited. Of the 20 recruited, 18 (90%) successfully passed the fit test. The median scores for comfort, ease of use, and everyday feasibility for the custom mask fitter were 3.5, 4.5, and 3, respectively, whereas the median score for comfort of a regular face mask was 8.5. CONCLUSION: A reusable, low-cost, 3D-printed custom mask fitter is a potential effective alternative to an N95 respirator among eye care professionals but may require improvement in its design and comfort.

Most Pakistani pregnant women now go to doctors and hospitals for their perinatal care. Yet traditional community midwives, called DāĪ in the singular and Dāyūn in the plural, still attend 24% of all Pakistani births, primarily in rural areas. In this article, via data collected from 16 interviews—5 with Dāyūn and 11 with mothers, we explore a maternity care system in tension between the past and the present, the DāĪ and the doctor. We ask, what does the maternity care provided by the Dāyūn look like during times of normalcy, and how does it differ during COVID-19? We look at the roles the DāĪ has traditionally performed and how these roles have been changing, both in ordinary and in Covidian circumstances. Presenting the words of the Dāyūn we interviewed, all from Pakistan’s Sindh Province, we demonstrate their practices and show that these have not changed during this present pandemic, as these Dāyūn, like many others in Sindh Province, do not believe that COVID-19 is real—or are at least suspect that it is not. To contextualize the Dāyūn, we also briefly present local mother’s perceptions of the Dāyūn in their regions, which vary between extremely positive and extremely negative. Employing the theoretical frameworks of “authoritative knowledge” and of critical medical anthropology, we highlight the dominance of “modern” biomedicine over “traditional” healthcare systems and its effects on the Dāyūn and their roles within their communities. Positioning this article within Pakistan’s national profile, we propose formally training and institutionalizing the Dāyūn in order to alleviate the overwhelming burdens that pandemics—present and future—place on this country’s fragile maternity care system, to give mothers more—and more viable—options at all times, and to counterbalance the rising tide of biomedical hegemony over pregnancy and birth.",2021-05-07,"Ali, Inayat; Sadique, Salma; Ali, Shahbaz; Davis-Floyd, Robbie",Front Sociol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34026899/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fsoc.2021.622223,233874534.0,2021.0,314
11ycbgsr,PMC,"Modernities, Sciences, and Democracy",10.1007/978-0-387-09829-6_15,no-cc,"The “modern” in “modern science” is a relatively uninterrogated and untheorized concept within the sciences and in the philosophy, sociology, and history of science. This is so today at a time when other aspects of Western sciences have been fruitfully explored in critical and illuminating ways (see Christensen and Hansen, Chap. 13; and Skovsmose, Chap. 15). In particular, the exceptionalism and triumphalism characteristic of Western attitudes toward our sciences have been explicitly criticized and purportedly abandoned by many of the scholars working in science studies fields. By exceptionalism is meant the belief that Western sciences alone among all human knowledge systems are capable of grasping reality in its own terms—that these alone have the resources to escape the human tendency to project onto nature cultural assumptions, fears, and desires. By triumphalism is meant the assumption that the history of science consists of a history of achievements — that this history has no significant downsides. According to this view, Hiroshima, environmental destruction, the alienation of labour, escalating global militarism, the increasing gap between the “haves” and the ”have nots,” gender, race, and class inequalities — these and other undesirable social situations are all entirely consequences of social and political projects, to which the history of Western sciences makes no contribution. Such conventional Euro centric assumptions can no longer gather the support either in the West or elsewhere that they could once claim In recent decades a huge amount of literature on modernity has emerged from the social sciences and humanities. Stimulated by the massive shifts in local and global social formations during the last half of the Twentieth Century, and by the post-modern response to such changes, social theorists, literary and other cultural critics, and, especially, historians have debated the uneven and complex origins, nature, and desirable futures of modernity, modernization, and modernism. Such controversies about modernity are first and foremost about a culture's relation to its past and its possible futures. They arise as ways of asking what went wrong, and what needs to be corrected. The last half a century has witnessed the global decline and fall of belief in the unquestionably legitimate authority of the white, bourgeois, male. Contributing to the epistemological, economic, political, and cultural rubble left by his demise — or, at least, deflation — have been compelling and influential counter-histories of social relations between the races, classes, genders, and within colonial and imperial eras",,"Harding, Sandra",University Science and Mathematics Education in Transition,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120505/,,,399

We provide evidence that internal migration through a specific land route is a significant factor progressively overriding the protection from COVID-19 afforded by high altitude. This protection is independent of poverty indexes and is inversely correlated with the prevalence of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Discussion: Long-term adaptation to residency at high altitude may be the third general protective factor from COVID-19 severity and death, after young age and female sex.

Indeed, cataract causes more than half of all cases of visual impairment in those countries with limited availability of means for performing eye operations (e.g., Africa or India). In this scenario, the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) quickly resulted in the suspension or sharp reduction of various ophthalmic activities considered non-urgent, including lens replacement surgery or some intraocular injections. Despite the imperative need to continuously practice eye operations to avoid the abovementioned problems, there are currently little-shared and vague recommendations among the various countries on safety in operating rooms (for health care workers and patients) and poor legal protection for surgeons (potentially transmitting the COVID-19 infectious agent). Herein, we individuated and discussed some critical points in safety recommendations and medical liability. A paradigm shift for ocular surgery during the COVID-19 era is now mandatory.

Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were used to contain the source in Xinfadi (XFD) market. To rapidly control the outbreak, both traditional and newly introduced NPIs including large-scale management of high-risk populations and expanded severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) PCR-based screening in the general population were conducted in Beijing. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of the response to the COVID-19 outbreak in Beijing’s XFD market and inform future response efforts of resurgence across regions. METHODS: A modified susceptible–exposed–infectious–recovered (SEIR) model was developed and applied to evaluate a range of different scenarios from the public health perspective. Two outcomes were measured: magnitude of transmission (i.e., number of cases in the outbreak) and endpoint of transmission (i.e., date of containment). The outcomes of scenario evaluations were presented relative to the reality case (i.e., 368 cases in 34 days) with 95% Confidence Interval (CI). RESULTS: Our results indicated that a 3 to 14 day delay in the identification of XFD as the infection source and initiation of NPIs would have caused a 3 to 28-fold increase in total case number (31–77 day delay in containment). A failure to implement the quarantine scheme employed in the XFD outbreak for defined key population would have caused a fivefold greater number of cases (73 day delay in containment). Similarly, failure to implement the quarantine plan executed in the XFD outbreak for close contacts would have caused twofold greater transmission (44 day delay in containment). Finally, failure to implement expanded nucleic acid screening in the general population would have yielded 1.6-fold greater transmission and a 32 day delay to containment. CONCLUSIONS: This study informs new evidence that in form the selection of NPI to use as countermeasures in response to a COVID-19 outbreak and optimal timing of their implementation. The evidence provided by this study should inform responses to future outbreaks of COVID-19 and future infectious disease outbreak preparedness efforts in China and elsewhere.

This depends on whether the radiation is ionizing or nonionizing. Despite its vast applications in surgery, dermatology and cosmetics, little is taught and thus known about non-ionizing radiation. This review article discusses the fundamentals of non-ionizing electromagnetic radiations. The main aim is to extensively explain the different types of non-ionizing radiation. This will equip students and medical personnel with knowledge on different medical applications and expose them to a variety of specializations in medicine that utilize non-ionizing radiation. The article discusses the physics, hazard, means of protection and medical application of each type of radiation: ultraviolet radiation, light (both visible light and LASER), infrared radiation, microwaves and extremely low frequency radiation separately. It presents these terms in a simple manner that avoids rigors mathematics and physics, which makes them comprehensible for medical students. The development of new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches could also lead to increased hazards to the body unless they are treated with precaution. If not adequately monitored, a significant health risk may be posed to potentially exposed employees. Hence proper dosage should be used for non-ionizing radiation. This is only possible through understanding of the risks/benefits of these radiations by studying the physics and radiobiological effects of each individual radiation.",2021-06-01,"Omer, Hiba",Saudi J Biol Sci,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sjbs.2021.05.071; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34588869/,236394604.0,2021.0,226
ba6p5pk1,Medline; PMC; WHO,A Methodological Approach to Use Contextual Factors for Epidemiological Studies on Chronic Exposure to Air Pollution and COVID-19 in Italy,10.3390/ijerph19052859,cc-by,"The large availability of both air pollution and COVID-19 data, and the simplicity to make geographical correlations between them, led to a proliferation of ecological studies relating the levels of pollution in administrative areas to COVID-19 incidence, mortality or lethality rates. However, the major drawback of these studies is the ecological fallacy that can lead to spurious associations. In this frame, an increasing concern has been addressed to clarify the possible role of contextual variables such as municipalities’ characteristics (including urban, rural, semi-rural settings), those of the resident communities, the network of social relations, the mobility of people, and the responsiveness of the National Health Service (NHS), to better clarify the dynamics of the phenomenon. The objective of this paper is to identify and collect the municipalities’ and community contextual factors and to synthesize their information content to produce suitable indicators in national environmental epidemiological studies, with specific emphasis on assessing the possible role of air pollution on the incidence and severity of the COVID-19 disease. A first step was to synthesize the content of spatial information, available at the municipal level, in a smaller set of “summary indexes” that can be more easily viewed and analyzed. For the 7903 Italian municipalities (1 January 2020—ISTAT), 44 variables were identified, collected, and grouped into five information dimensions a priori defined: (i) geographic characteristics of the municipality, (ii) demographic and anthropogenic characteristics, (iii) mobility, (iv) socio-economic-health area, and (v) healthcare offer (source: ISTAT, EUROSTAT or Ministry of Health, and further ad hoc elaborations (e.g., OpenStreetMaps)). Principal component analysis (PCA) was carried out for the five identified dimensions, with the aim of reducing the large number of initial variables into a smaller number of components, limiting as much as possible the loss of information content (variability). We also included in the analysis PM(2.5), PM(10) and NO(2) population weighted exposure (PWE) values obtained using a four-stage approach based on the machine learning method, “random forest”, which uses space–time predictors, satellite data, and air quality monitoring data estimated at the national level. Overall, the PCA made it possible to extract twelve components: three for the territorial characteristics dimension of the municipality (variance explained 72%), two for the demographic and anthropogenic characteristics dimension (variance explained 62%), three for the mobility dimension (variance explained 83%), two for the socio-economic-health sector (variance explained 58%) and two for the health offer dimension (variance explained 72%). All the components of the different dimensions are only marginally correlated with each other, demonstrating their potential ability to grasp different aspects of the spatial distribution of the COVID-19 pathology. This work provides a national repository of contextual variables at the municipality level collapsed into twelve informative factors suitable to be used in studies on the association between chronic exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 pathology, as well as for investigations on the role of air pollution on the health of the Italian population.",2022-03-01,"Bauleo, Lisa; Giannini, Simone; Ranzi, Andrea; Nobile, Federica; Stafoggia, Massimo; Ancona, Carla; Iavarone, Ivano",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35270551/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19052859,247204677.0,2022.0,480

Methods: We conducted a retrospective, observational study on the Portuguese Pharmacovigilance System database, between 03/2020 and 12/2020. We selected Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR) reports that contained Hydroxychloroquine and Remdesivir as suspected drugs and excluded reports that contained more than one drug as suspected of causing ADR. The analyses performed for each drug under study were as follows: (1) seriousness, (2) type of ADR – Preferred Term hierarchy level coding, according to the MedDRA, (3) description of ADR in the SmPC and (4) characteristics of the patient (age and sex). Results: Of the 147 ADR reports, 61 (41.5%) are to Hydroxychloroquine, and 87 (58.5%) are to Remdesivir. Regarding the seriousness criteria, there was a percentage of seriousness reports above 80% in both groups. For Hydroxychloroquine, the five most frequent ADRs were: cholestasis (23.2%), hepatocellular injury (14.7%), condition aggravated (8.4%), pancytopenia (4.2%) and QT prolonged electrocardiogram (4.2%). 90% of these ADRs are described in the SmPC. Looking at Remdesivir, the five most frequent ADRs were: increased transaminases (21.7%), renal impairment (9.6%), alanine aminotransferase increased (7.0%), blood creatinine increased (4.35%) and bradycardia (4.35%). Regarding the description of ADRs for this drug in the SmPC, only 38% are described. For both drugs, male patients are the ones who have more ADR (54% for Hydroxychloroquine and 68% for Remdesivir), and the average age is higher in patients taking Hidoxychloroquine (68 years;SD 16 years) than in patients taking Remdesivir (62 years;SD 18 years).

Prediction models may assist in triaging patients. We aimed to assess the value of several prediction models in COVID-19 patients in the emergency department (ED). METHODS: In this retrospective study, ED patients with COVID-19 were included. Prediction models were selected based on their feasibility. Primary outcome was 30-day mortality, secondary outcomes were 14-day mortality and a composite outcome of 30-day mortality and admission to medium care unit (MCU) or intensive care unit (ICU). The discriminatory performance of the prediction models was assessed using an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS: We included 403 patients. Thirty-day mortality was 23.6%, 14-day mortality was 19.1%, 66 patients (16.4%) were admitted to ICU, 48 patients (11.9%) to MCU, and 152 patients (37.7%) met the composite endpoint. Eleven prediction models were included. The RISE UP score and 4 C mortality scores showed very good discriminatory performance for 30-day mortality (AUC 0.83 and 0.84, 95% CI 0.79-0.88 for both), significantly higher than that of the other models.

This threshold corresponds to points where the stability of the system’s equilibrium reaches zero. Consequently, we use the average rate at which deviations from the equilibrium shrink to define a distance to this threshold. However, the vital dynamics of the host population may occur slowly even when transmission is far from threshold levels. Here we show analytically how such slow dynamics can prevent estimation of the distance to the threshold for some individual variables of the model. Although these results are exact only in the limit of long-term observation of a large system, we find that they still provide useful insight into the behaviour of estimates from simulations with a range of population sizes, environmental noise, and observation schemes. Having established some guidelines about when estimates are accurate, we then illustrate how multiple distance estimates can be used to estimate the rate of approach to the threshold. The estimation approach is general and may be applicable to zoonotic pathogens such as MERS-CoV as well as vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles.",2018-04-17,"O’Dea, Eamon B.; Park, Andrew W.; Drake, John M.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/247734,196636686.0,2018.0,191

However, the application of RPS to the field of gastrectomy is still underdeveloped. We started laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy through an umbilical port plus another 5 mm port (dual port laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy: DP-LATG) as an RPS for laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy (LATG). A SILS™ port was inserted into an umbilical incision, while another 5 mm port was inserted at the right flank region. We performed DP-LATG on ten early gastric cancer cases consecutively from May 2011 onwards, with the surgeries all performed by a single surgeon. The results of DP-LATG were compared with the resuls of ten conventional LATGs (C-LATGs) that were performed between March 2010 and April 2011.

This paper seeks to understand the relationship between exposure to biased media outlets and the likelihood of testing positive for COVID-19 in the USA. I use detailed household data extracted from the 2020 American National Election Study in order to gauge media consumption patterns, coupled with data on media bias scores for different outlets and programmes. I combine these variables to compute media bias exposure values for each respondent, and relate these to the likelihood of a positive COVID-19 test within each respondent’s household, controlling for a variety of other factors including partisanship, social media use, trust in the media and several socioeconomic and demographic variables. The results indicate that media bias exposure is significantly related to COVID-19 incidence, and in particular the coefficients show that a 1% increase in exposure to left-wing media is associated with a 0.2% decrease in the probability of a positive COVID-19 test. Conversely, I find no significant relationship between right-wing media exposure and COVID-19 infection rates.

In lung tissue specimens from patients with stable, mild COPD and from control smokers without airflow obstruction, we determined the prevalence and load of nucleic acid from common respiratory viruses and concomitant inflammation of small airways measuring less than 2-mm in diameter. METHODS Frozen lung tissue obtained from patients with stable, mild COPD (n = 20) and control subjects (n = 20) underwent real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) for 13 respiratory viruses, and quantitative histology for inflammation of small airways. The two groups were compared for viral prevalence and load, and airway inflammation. The relationship between viral load and airway inflammatory cells was also analyzed. RESULTS Viral nucleic acid were detected in lung tissue of 18/40 (45.0%) of the individuals studied and included seven co-infections that were characterized by a ""dominant virus"" contributing to most of the total measured viral load. Lung tissue of COPD patients had a significantly higher prevalence of viral nucleic acid (particularly influenza A virus), and increased inflammation of small airways by macrophages and neutrophils versus controls. In qPCR-positive individuals, linear regression analysis showed a direct correlation between viral load and airway neutrophils, and between influenza A virus load and airway macrophages.

A total of 256 Ross 308 male broilers were assigned to 4 treatments (8 birds/cage, 8 cages/treatment) in a completely randomized design. Treatments comprised a positive control (PC, 2,975 kcal/kg ME, 3.7 g/kg dig P, 2.83 g/kg PP, 8.4 g/kg Ca, 10.6 g/kg dig lysine), a negative control (NC) without added Pi (ME -68 kcal/kg, crude protein -10 g/kg, dig AA -0.1 to -0.4 g/kg, Ca -2.0 g/kg, dig P -2.2 g/kg, Na -0.4 g/kg, vs. PC), and NC plus 500 or 1,000 FTU/kg of PhyG. Test diets were corn/soy/rapeseed-meal/rice-bran-based and fed from 5 to 15 d of age. Ileal digesta and tibias were collected on d 15.

We investigated the characteristics of Roche's Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (S) assay, a quantitative commercial assay for antibodies against the spike glycoprotein. Antibody levels were reduced relative to plasma following elution from DBS.

METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study conducted in Saudi Arabia in April 2020. An electronic self-administered questionnaire was distributed to PWE via their treating neurologist. The variables included were demographic and baseline clinical characteristics (age, gender, living situation, occupational status, type of epilepsy, duration of epilepsy, number of antiepileptic medications (AEDs), presence of known psychiatric illness, and use of psychiatric medications), their seizure control in the month prior to the pandemic, perceived stress during this period of time, sleep changes, compliance changes, and change in seizure control during the pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 156 patients completed the questionnaire, with 29.5% reporting an increase in seizure frequency. Additionally, 59.4% reported an increase in self-reported stress and 71.2% experienced a significant change in their sleep during this period. Higher baseline seizure frequency, more AEDs, noncompliance, increase in self-reported stress, and sleep changes are the significant factors associated with increase in seizure frequency during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Identifying high-risk patients for seizure recurrence is important in order to provide them with adequate support to reduce such risk.",,"Alkhotani, Amal; Siddiqui, Muhammad I; Almuntashri, Fahad; Baothman, Renad",Epilepsy Behav,,220499069.0,,202

qfod1cay,Medline,Antisperm antibodies and testicular blood flow after inguinal hernia mesh repair.,10.1007/s00464-014-3614-7,unk,"BACKGROUND Testicular flow studies after hernia mesh repair mostly showed different outcomes. The reason of infertility in some men after hernia repair is immunological factors. Aim of the study was to investigate the influence of mesh hernia repair on antisperm antibodies production and testicular blood flow and a connection among these parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS A prospective interventional longitudinal cohort study was made on 82 male patients without exclusion criteria who had an inguinal hernia. Patients underwent laparoscopic TAPP or open tension-free hernia repair. Vascular ultrasound and antisperm antibodies were measured in the preoperative and postoperative periods. Main outcome measures were resistive index (RI), peak systolic velocity (PSV) cm/s, and end-diastolic velocity (EDV) cm/s in testicular blood flow measurement and the quantitative value of antisperm antibodies (ASA) in serum (IU/ml). RESULTS ASA significantly increased postoperatively only in patients who underwent open tension-free hernia repair (p < 0.001). ASA stayed in normal range in all patients except the one with postoperative complication. Friedman analysis showed significant change of the RI only on intratesticular (p < 0.001) and capsular artery level (0.02) in patients who underwent laparoscopic technique. PSV significantly changed on intratesticular (p < 0.001) and capsular artery level (p = 0.015) in the laparoscopic hernia repair. PSV showed significant change on intratesticular (p < 0.001) and testicular artery levels (p < 0.001) in the open tension-free hernia repair. EDV showed significant change only on testicular artery level (p = 0.032) in the patients who had open tension-free hernia repair. These blood flow parameters significantly increased in the early postoperative period and returned on basal value in the late postoperative period. Parameters of flow did not show any significant correlation with ASA. CONCLUSION Mesh hernia repairs without complication caused only a transitory change in testicular blood flow and no clinical significant autoimmune reaction.",,"Štula, Ivana; Družijanić, Nikica; Sapunar, Ada; Perko, Zdravko; Bošnjak, Nada; Kraljević, Damir",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-014-3614-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24962853/,19880270.0,,302

The metaverse roadmap categorizes the metaverse into 4 types: augmented reality, lifelogging, mirror world, and virtual reality. An example of the application of augmented reality in medical education would be an augmented reality T-shirt that allows students to examine the inside of the human body as an anatomy lab. Furthermore, a research team in a hospital in Seoul developed a spinal surgery platform that applied augmented reality technology. The potential of the metaverse as a new educational environment is suggested to be as follows: a space for new social communication; a higher degree of freedom to create and share; and the provision of new experiences and high immersion through virtualization. Some of its limitations may be weaker social connections and the possibility of privacy impingement; the commission of various crimes due to the virtual space and anonymity of the metaverse; and maladaptation to the real world for students whose identity has not been established. The metaverse is predicted to change our daily life and economy beyond the realm of games and entertainment. The metaverse has infinite potential as a new social communication space. The following future tasks are suggested for the educational use of the metaverse: first, teachers should carefully analyze how students understand the metaverse; second, teachers should design classes for students to solve problems or perform projects cooperatively and creatively; third, educational metaverse platforms should be developed that prevent misuse of student data.",2021-12-13,"Kye, Bokyung; Han, Nara; Kim, Eunji; Park, Yeonjeong; Jo, Soyoung",J Educ Eval Health Prof,https://doi.org/10.3352/jeehp.2021.18.32; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34897242/,245127814.0,2021.0,257

Early detection of canine parvovirus (CPV-2) is crucial to initiating appropriate outbreak control strategies. Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), a novel isothermal gene amplification technique, has been developed for the molecular detection of diverse pathogens. In this study, a real-time RPA assay was developed for the detection of CPV-2 using primers and an exo probe targeting the CPV-2 nucleocapsid protein gene. RESULTS: The real-time RPA assay was performed successfully at 38 °C, and the results were obtained within 4–12 min for 10(5)–10(1) molecules of template DNA. The assay only detected CPV-2, and did not show cross-detection of other viral pathogens, demonstrating a high level of specificity. The analytical sensitivity of the real-time RPA was 10(1) copies/reaction of a standard DNA template, which was 10 times more sensitive than the common RPA method. The clinical sensitivity of the real-time RPA assay matched 100% (n = 91) to the real-time PCR results. CONCLUSION: The real-time RPA assay is a simple, rapid, reliable and affordable method that can potentially be applied for the detection of CPV-2 in the research laboratory and point-of-care diagnosis.

Pregnant women infected with influenza A virus were at increased risk of hospitalization and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is associated with high mortality, while their newborns had an increased risk of pre-term birth or low birth weight. Pregnant women have a unique immunological profile modulated by the sex hormones required to maintain pregnancy, namely progesterone and estrogens. The role of these hormones in coordinating maternal immunotolerance in uterine tissue and cellular subsets has been well researched; however, these hormones have wide-ranging effects outside the uterus in modulating the immune response to disease. In this review, we compile research findings in the clinic and in animal models that elaborate on the unique features of H1N1 influenza A viral pathogenesis during pregnancy, the crosstalk between innate immune signaling and hormonal regulation during pregnancy, and the role of pregnancy hormones in modulating cellular responses to influenza A viral infection at mid-gestation. We highlight the ways in which lung architecture and function is stressed by pregnancy, increasing baseline inflammation prior to infection. We demonstrate that infection disrupts progesterone production and upregulates inflammatory mediators, such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and prostaglandins, resulting in pre-term labor and spontaneous abortions. Lastly, we profile the ways in which pregnancy alters innate and adaptive cellular immune responses to H1N1 influenza viral infection, and the ways in which these protect fetal development at the expense of effective long-term immune memory. Thus, we highlight advancements in the field of reproductive immunology in response to viral infection and illustrate how that knowledge might be used to develop more effective post-infection therapies and vaccination strategies.",2018-10-29,"Littauer, Elizabeth Q.; Skountzou, Ioanna",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2018.02455; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30420854/,53083446.0,2018.0,281
spuk3wt2,WHO,A systematic review of human coronaviruses survival on environmental surfaces,,unk,"The current pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led people to implement preventive measures, including surface disinfection and use of alcohol-based hand gel, in order to avoid viral transmission via fomites. However, the role of surface transmission is still debated. The present systematic review aims to summarize all the evidence on surface survival of coronaviruses infecting humans. The analysis of 18 studies showed the longest coronavirus survival time is 28 days at room temperature (RT) on different surfaces: polymer banknotes, vinyl, steel, glass, and paper banknotes. Concerning SARS-CoV-2 human infection from contaminated surfaces, dangerous viral load on surfaces for up to 21 days was determined on polymer banknotes, steel, glass and paper banknotes. For viruses other than SARS-CoV-2, the longest period of survival was 14 days, recorded on glass. Environmental conditions can affect virus survival, and indeed, low temperatures and low humidity support prolonged survival of viruses on contaminated surfaces independently of surface type. Furthermore, it has been shown that exposure to sunlight significantly reduces the risk of surface transmission. Although studies are increasingly investigating the topic of coronavirus survival, it is difficult to compare them, given the methodology differences. For this reason, it is advisable to define a reference working protocol for virus survival trials, but, as an immediate measure, there is also a need for further investigations of coronavirus survival on surfaces.",,"Marzoli, Filippo; Bortolami, Alessio; Pezzuto, Alessandra; Mazzetto, Eva; Piro, Roberto; Terregino, Calogero; Bonfante, Francesco; Belluco, Simone",Sci Total Environ,,232105770.0,,229

DESIGN: Interpretive descriptive qualitative study. METHODS: Twenty to 25 youth aged 10-18 years with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes will be purposively recruited through the Diabetes Education Resource for Children and Adolescents in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and through the Improving Renal Complications in Adolescents With Type 2 Diabetes Through the REsearch [iCARE] cohort. Socio-demographic information will be collected. Semi-structured interviews will occur iteratively with inductive thematic analysis. Data will be professionally transcribed and managed using NVivo 1.0 software. The University Ethics Committee approved this study (May 2020). DISCUSSION: There is a critical gap in understanding youth experiences of type 2 diabetes. Research involving youth with type 2 diabetes is predominantly quantitative in nature, largely reflecting risk factors, underlying mechanisms and treatment outcomes associated with diabetes management. In-depth qualitative research on youth experiences can help identify youth priorities, provide insight into critical misalignments between stakeholder perspectives, and drive forward a more consolidated youth-centred research agenda. IMPACT: Understanding and applying knowledge of youth experiences is critical as the prevalence of, and challenges associated with, youth onset type 2 diabetes continues to increase worldwide. This research will generate a robust interpretive description of youth lived experiences and perceptions of type 2 diabetes where such research is lacking, to inform basic and applied research within an interdisciplinary investigative and clinical research team with relevance to other jurisdictions.

yfus4lig,Medline; WHO,BOLD Monitoring in the Neural Simulator ANNarchy,10.3389/fninf.2022.790966,unk,"Multi-scale network models that simultaneously simulate different measurable signals at different spatial and temporal scales, such as membrane potentials of single neurons, population firing rates, local field potentials, and blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals, are becoming increasingly popular in computational neuroscience. The transformation of the underlying simulated neuronal activity of these models to simulated non-invasive measurements, such as BOLD signals, is particularly relevant. The present work describes the implementation of a BOLD monitor within the neural simulator ANNarchy to allow an on-line computation of simulated BOLD signals from neural network models. An active research topic regarding the simulation of BOLD signals is the coupling of neural processes to cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2). The flexibility of ANNarchy allows users to define this coupling with a high degree of freedom and thus, not only allows to relate mesoscopic network models of populations of spiking neurons to experimental BOLD data, but also to investigate different hypotheses regarding the coupling between neural processes, CBF and CMRO2 with these models. In this study, we demonstrate how simulated BOLD signals can be obtained from a network model consisting of multiple spiking neuron populations. We first demonstrate the use of the Balloon model, the predominant model for simulating BOLD signals, as well as the possibility of using novel user-defined models, such as a variant of the Balloon model with separately driven CBF and CMRO2 signals. We emphasize how different hypotheses about the coupling between neural processes, CBF and CMRO2 can be implemented and how these different couplings affect the simulated BOLD signals. With the BOLD monitor presented here, ANNarchy provides a tool for modelers who want to relate their network models to experimental MRI data and for scientists who want to extend their studies of the coupling between neural processes and the BOLD signal by using modeling approaches. This facilitates the investigation and model-based analysis of experimental BOLD data and thus improves multi-scale understanding of neural processes in humans.",,"Maith, Oliver; Dinkelbach, Helge Ülo; Baladron, Javier; Vitay, Julien; Hamker, Fred H",Front Neuroinform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35392282/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fninf.2022.790966,247769093.0,,327

Belonging to the betacoronavirus family, it primarily spreads through human contact via symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission. Despite several attempts since it emerged, there is no known treatment in the form of drugs or vaccines. Hence, work on developing a potential multi-subunit vaccine is the need of the hour. In this study, attempts have been made to find globally conserved epitopes from the entire set of SARS-CoV-2 proteins as there is as yet, no clear information on the immunogenicity of these proteins. Using diverse computational tools, a ranked list of probable immunogenic, promiscuous epitopes generated through all the three main stages of antigen processing and presentation pathways has been prioritized. Moreover, several useful insights were gleaned during these analyses. One of the most important insights is that all of the proteins in this pathogen present unique epitopes, so that the targeting of a few specific viral proteins is not likely to result in an effective immune response in humans. Due to the presence of these unique epitopes in all of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins, stronger immune responses generated by T cell hyperactivation may lead to cytokine storm and immunopathology and consequently, remote chances of human survival. These epitopes, after due validation in vitro, may thus need to be presented to the human body in that form of multi-subunit epitope-based vaccine that avoids such immunopathologies.",2020-09-16,"Mishra, Seema",R Soc Open Sci,https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.201141; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33047062/,221714984.0,2020.0,240
rwuy73h4,ArXiv,A fractional-order SEIHDR model for COVID-19 with inter-city networked coupling effects,,arxiv,"In this paper, a mathematical model is proposed to analyze the dynamic behavior of COVID-19. Based on inter-city networked coupling effects, a fractional-order SEIHDR system with the real-data from 23 January to 18 March, 2020 of COVID-19 is discussed. Meanwhile, hospitalized individuals and the mortality rates of three types of individuals (exposed, infected and hospitalized) are firstly taken into account in the proposed model. And infectivity of individuals during incubation is also considered in this paper. By applying least squares method and predictor-correctors scheme, the numerical solutions of the proposed system in the absence of the inter-city network and with the inter-city network are stimulated by using the real-data from 23 January to $18-m$ March, 2020 where $m$ is equal to the number of prediction days. Compared with integer-order system ($\alpha=0$), the fractional-order model without network is validated to have a better fitting of the data on Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Huanggang and other cities. In contrast to the case without network, the results indicate that the inter-city network system may be not a significant case to virus spreading for China because of the lock down and quarantine measures, however, it may have an impact on cities that have not adopted city closure. Meanwhile, the proposed model better fits the data from 24 February to 31, March in Italy, and the peak number of confirmed people is also predicted by this fraction-order model.

After a month, the number of confirmed cases surged, as community transmission occurred. The local hospitals experienced severe shortages in medical resources such as mechanical ventilators and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) equipment. With the medical claims data of 7,590 COVID-19 confirmed patients, this study examined how the demand for major medical resources and medications changed during the outbreak and subsequent stabilization period of COVID-19 in South Korea. We also aimed to investigate how the underlying diseases and demographic factors affect disease severity. Our findings revealed that the risk of being treated with a mechanical ventilator or ECMO (critical condition) was almost twice as high in men, and a previous history of hypertension, diabetes, and psychiatric diseases increased the risk for progressing to critical condition [Odds Ratio (95% CI), 1.60 (1.14–2.24); 1.55 (1.55–2.06); 1.73 (1.25–2.39), respectively]. Although chronic pulmonary disease did not significantly increase the risk for severity of the illness, patients with a Charlson comorbidity index score of ≥5 and those treated in an outbreak area had an increased risk of developing a critical condition [3.82 (3.82–8.15); 1.59 (1.20–2.09), respectively].

Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at the highest risk of exposure to COVID-19 and, therefore, they are the priority group for vaccination. Objectives The study aimed to examine the perceptions, attitudes, and acceptability of the COVID-19 vaccination among HCWs in India. Study design A cross-sectional pilot survey was conducted using an online questionnaire between 13 and 25 January 2021. Results Among 264 respondents, 40.2% of HCWs would receive the vaccine against COVID-19 if available and 32.2% were willing to take the vaccine after observing adverse effects in others. Infected members in the immediate social network (OR:2.15; 95%CI:0.426-10.844), COVID-19 knowledge (OR:5.113; 95%CI:0.974-26.853), the safety of vaccines (OR:7.608; 95%CI:2.618-22.11), and those who did not receive a flu vaccine last year (OR:2.612; 95%CI:1.120-6.091) were found to have a statistically significant association with vaccine acceptance. The main reasons to delay/refuse vaccination included: ‘quick vaccine development and compromised quality’ (43.7%) and ‘lack of trusted information regarding COVID-19’ (41.3%).

In this study, we examined anxiety and depression symptoms during the pandemic in a large sample of pregnant individuals (n=8602). For a sub-sample of participants, their infants underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3-months of age to examine whether this prenatal maternal distress was associated with infant brain changes. We found significantly elevated prenatal maternal distress compared to pre-pandemic rates, with 47% and 33% of participants reporting clinically significant symptoms of anxiety and depression, respectively. Importantly, we identified social support as a protective factor for clinically elevated prenatal maternal distress. We found significant relationships between prenatal maternal distress and infant amygdala-prefrontal microstructural and functional connectivity and demonstrate for the first time that social support moderates this relationship. Our findings suggest a potentially long-lasting impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children and show that social support acts as a protective factor not just for pregnant individuals, but also for their developing infants.

Because the latter are primarily territorial, research related to diagnosis and prevention of echinococcosis requires investigation of environmental factors, which can be supported with the use of a Geographical Information System (GIS). In particular, since this type of research is usually performed by a team of medical researchers working individually with many patients, it can greatly benefit from the use of a Web-GIS, which provides remote access to data integration, storage and analysis tools. However, most existing Web-GIS solutions dedicated for disease mapping either exhibit limited functionality and interactivity (often due to the use of a thin-client approach) or are tied to a particular technological platform through a thick client based on a browser plugin. Moreover, few of the existing solutions provide user-friendly tools for data input, and none is directly integrated into the workflow of clinicians. This paper proposes a novel system architecture for Web-GIS dedicated to disease mapping, which attempts to optimize the use of client and server hardware resources while providing the user with a variety of analytic functionalities. The proposed architecture has been implemented in the form of a system for remote mapping and analysis of echinococcosis cases in Poland, which has been designed in cooperation with a major Polish hospital centre.",2022-02-23,"Kulawiak, Marcin; Kulawiak, Natalia; Sulima, Małgorzata; Sikorska, Katarzyna",Appl Geomat,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8863514/,,2022.0,235

Ayurveda, the oldest healing schema of Traditional Indian Medicinal (TIM) system, is considered as a promising CAM therapy to combat various diseases/ disorders. To explore the regulatory mechanisms of 3038 Ayurvedic herbs (AHs) against SARS-CoV-2, in this study, multi-targeting and synergistic actions of constituent 34,472 phytochemicals (APCs) are investigated using a comprehensive approach comprising of network pharmacology and molecular docking. Immunomodulatory prospects of antiviral drug-alike potentially effective phytochemicals (PEPs) are presented as a special case study, highlighting the importance of 6 AHs in eliciting the antiviral immunity. By evaluating binding affinity of 292 PEPs against 24 SARS-CoV-2 proteins, we develop and analyze a high-confidence “bi-regulatory network” of 115 PEPs having ability to regulate protein targets in both virus and its host human system. Furthermore, mechanistic actions of PEPs against cardiovascular complications, diabetes mellitus and hypertension are also investigated to address the regulatory potential of AHs in dealing with COVID-19-associated metabolic comorbidities. The study further reports 12 PEPs as promising source of COVID-19 comorbidity regulators.

METHOD Following a focus group session with eight practicing DNPs, the focus group shared how their roles effected safer health care. RESULTS Final takeaways included their commitment to safer health care and prevention, moving care to the community, and a wish for more variety in projects generated in workplaces. Three themes emerged from the data: DNP leadership practice affects health outcomes through improved quality of care, influence, and innovation; DNP strengths include communication, leadership, and ability to change others' thinking; and the influence of DNP-prepared leaders at all external levels occurs through both increasing awareness of the role and influencing in multiple areas. DNP challenges include lack of understanding by others of the role and the lack of recognition and respect for their educational preparation. CONCLUSION Leading, innovating, and communicating during constantly changing care models are key skills needed during the current health care crisis. These skills are basic to DNP practice.

The authors examined whether leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) shares genetic and environmental variances between spelling, essay writing, reading aloud, reading comprehension, and mathematics in early adolescence. Moreover, they investigated whether genetic polymorphisms associated with physical activity behavior affect these academic skills. METHODS: Participants were 12-year-old Finnish twins (n = 4356-4370 twins/academic skill, 49% girls). Academic skills were assessed by teachers, and LTPA was self-reported. Polygenic scores for physical activity behavior were constructed from the UK Biobank. Quantitative genetic modeling and linear regression models were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: The trait correlations between LTPA and academic skills were significant but weak (r = .05-.08). The highest trait correlation was found between LTPA and mathematics. A significant genetic correlation was revealed between LTPA and essay writing (rA = .14). Regarding polygenic scores of physical activity, the highest correlations were found with reading comprehension, spelling, and essay writing, but these results only approached statistical significance (P values = .09-.15). CONCLUSIONS: The authors' results suggest that reading and writing are the academic skills that most likely share a common genetic background with LTPA.",,"Aaltonen, Sari; Palviainen, Teemu; Rose, Richard J; Kujala, Urho M; Kaprio, Jaakko; Silventoinen, Karri",J Phys Act Health,,235472056.0,,202

As physicians are the ultimate role models for patients regarding health and well-being, we focused on physicians working in primary healthcare centers (PHCs) in Makkah because they work on the frontline of disease prevention and are considered the first point of contact for patients entering the health system. This study aimed to estimate the physical activity levels in physicians working in the PHCs of Makkah and any perceived barriers to engage in physical activity. Methodology We conducted a cross-sectional study at PHCs in Makkah from October 2021 to December 2021. We used a multistage cluster random sampling technique to select primary healthcare physicians in Makkah city. We recruited 196 physicians working in PHCs for this study. We used the short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire to measure physical activity levels, and we used the barriers to being active questionnaire to identify the barriers. Descriptive analysis was performed using frequencies. Bivariate associations between the most frequently reported barriers and sociodemographic variables were determined using the chi-square test, Student t-test, and analysis of variance via IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 22.0 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). Results Approximately 45.9% of physicians were overweight, while 69.4% were not gym members. In the seven days prior to answering the surveys, approximately 71.9% did not report any vigorous activity, and 30.6% had performed moderate activity. The most significant barrier to being active was a lack of time (70.9%), followed by a lack of resources (69.9%). In bivariate analysis, we noted a significant negative relationship between gym membership, vigorous and moderate physical activity, and perceived barriers scores (p<0.001).

RESULTS: Forty percent of ICU patients did contaminate their environment. No particular trend emerged regarding the type of surface contaminated. Modality of oxygen support (high flow nasal cannula oxygenation, invasive mechanical ventilation, standard oxygen mask) was not associated with the risk of environmental contamination. By univariate analysis lymphopenia<0.7 G·L(−1) was associated to environmental contamination. CONCLUSION: Despite small effective, our study generate surprising results. Modality of oxygen support is not associated with risk of environmental contamination.

The especially stressful circumstances of the pandemic may mean that regular debriefing with a supervisor is necessary. The onerous rota may prohibit lengthy meetings but coaching-style conversations may be a valuable adjunct in the communication between trainee and supervisor.We developed a pilot communication skills training - with a focus on coaching skills - to enhance communication between supervisors and trainees.2 sessions facilitated by 2 coaches were held with 22 and 13 participants respectively in the summer of 2019. Participants explored and challenged their assumptions about the positive and negative ways trainees and supervisors interact with each other. The coaches then introduced the SBI feedback framework (Situation – Behaviour – Impact) and the TGROW coaching model. Working in small groups, participants used TGROW to coach one another on issues relating to their role as supervisors, rotating as coach/coachee/observer.TGROW is a solution-focused framework and leadership tool for structuring a coaching conversation. The acronym describes a 5-step coaching process: Topic - Goal - Reality - Options - Will & Way forward. The aim is to catalyse insight and motivation to change and grow through asking powerful questions linked to each of the model’s five steps.65% of our supervisors on the course (n=23) have previously found it difficult to engage with trainees. Following training, 50% of our supervisors felt increased confidence in their communication skills. Attendees found the workshop to be helpful to reflect on the changing medical culture and how coaching can be used to reach across perceived divides and disengagement.Our experience highlights some of the difficulty faced by supervisors when communicating with trainees.

The data came from Our World in Data, which is building the international COVID‐19 vaccination data set and is an open‐source data set for everyone to use. The vaccination data set uses the most recent official numbers from governments and health ministries worldwide. We assessed the correlation between COVID‐19 vaccine coverage rates and outcomes of the COVID‐19 epidemic with existing variants by performing temporal analysis and spatial analysis. Overall, new cases per million population, the reproduction rate of COVID‐19, new deaths from all causes per million population, excess mortality attributed to COVID‐19 pandemic, and hospital patients or intensive care unit (ICU) patients per million population were not decreased with the time course. However, at the same time point, new cases per million population, the reproduction rate of COVID‐19, new deaths per million population, and hospital patients or ICU patients per million population gradually decreased as the rate of vaccination coverage increased. High coverage percentages of COVID‐19 vaccination were negatively correlated with the reproduction rate of COVID‐19 (correlation coefficient −0.116) and ICU patients per million of the local population (correlation coefficient −0.055). Currently, there is no effective treatment for the COVID‐19 pandemic, and prevention of the COVID‐19 pandemic mainly depends on vaccines, especially when the rate of COVID‐19 vaccine coverage is over 60%.

Public dissemination of government policies, medical interventions, and misinformation has been remarkably rapid and largely unregulated during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in increased misinterpretations, miscommunication, and public panic. Being the first full-scale global pandemic of the digital age, COVID-19 has presented novel challenges pertinent to government advice, the spread of news and misinformation, and the trade-off between the accessibility of science and the premature public use of unproven medical interventions. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the use of internet search terms relating to COVID-19 information and misinformation during the global pandemic, identify which were most used in six affected countries, investigate any temporal trends and the likely propagators of key search terms, and determine any correlation between the per capita cases and deaths with the adoption of these search terms in each of the six countries. METHODS: This study uses relative search volume data extracted from Google Trends for search terms linked to the COVID-19 pandemic alongside per capita case and mortality data extracted from the European Open Data Portal to identify the temporal dynamics of the spread of news and misinformation during the global pandemic in six affected countries (Australia, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States). A correlation analysis was carried out to ascertain any correlation between the temporal trends of search term use and the rise of per capita mortality and disease cases. RESULTS: Of the selected search terms, most were searched immediately following promotion by governments, public figures, or viral circulation of information, but also in relation to the publication of scientific resources, which were sometimes misinterpreted before further dissemination. Strong correlations were identified between the volume of these COVID-19–related search terms (overall mean Spearman rho 0.753, SD 0.158), and per capita mortality (mean per capita deaths Spearman rho 0.690, SD 0.168) and cases (mean per capita cases Spearman rho 0.800, SD 0.112). CONCLUSIONS: These findings illustrate the increased rate and volume of the public consumption of novel information during a global health care crisis. The positive correlation between mortality and online searching, particularly in countries with lower COVID-19 testing rates, may demonstrate the imperative to safeguard official communications and dispel misinformation in these countries. Online news, government briefings, and social media provide a powerful tool for the dissemination of important information to the public during pandemics, but their misuse and the presentation of misrepresented medical information should be monitored, minimized, and addressed to safeguard public safety. Ultimately, governments, public health authorities, and scientists have a moral imperative to safeguard the truth and maintain an accessible discourse with the public to limit fear.",2020-10-27,"Badell-Grau, Rafael A; Cuff, Jordan Patrick; Kelly, Brendan P; Waller-Evans, Helen; Lloyd-Evans, Emyr",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32915763/; https://doi.org/10.2196/19791,221637463.0,2020.0,449

However, the currently available R package cosinor could only analyze daily cross-sectional data and compare the parameters between groups with two levels. To evaluate longitudinal changes in the circadian patterns, we need to extend the model to a mixed-effect model framework, allowing for random effects and interaction between COSINOR parameters and time-varying covariates. RESULTS: We developed the cosinoRmixedeffects R package for modelling longitudinal periodic data using mixed-effects cosinor models. The model allows for covariates and interactions with the non-linear parameters MESOR, amplitude, and acrophase. To facilitate ease of use, the package utilizes the syntax and functions of the widely used emmeans package to obtain estimated marginal means and contrasts. Estimation and hypothesis testing involving the non-linear circadian parameters are carried out using bootstrapping. We illustrate the package functionality by modelling daily measurements of heart rate variability (HRV) collected among health care workers over several months. Differences in circadian patterns of HRV between genders, BMI, and during infection with SARS-CoV2 are evaluated to illustrate how to perform hypothesis testing. CONCLUSION: cosinoRmixedeffects package provides the model fitting, estimation and hypothesis testing for the mixed-effects COSINOR model, for the linear and non-linear circadian parameters MESOR, amplitude and acrophase. The model accommodates factors with any number of categories, as well as complex interactions with circadian parameters and categorical factors.

Given the importance to assess the evolution and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 and to forecast the next scenario of the pandemic, mainly in countries with limited healthcare systems, we estimated the reproductive number (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), India, and a possible scenario for this pandemic in the region. SUBJECT AND METHODS: We estimated the reproductive number (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 in its first outbreak stage in the northwestern region of Himalaya, India, and we also predicted new daily cases for the next 90 days using different R0, testing a plausible end of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. RESULTS: Our results showed a considerable increase in the number of cases, but with a tendency to asymptote. Anantnag, Bandipora, Baramulla, Shopian, and Srinagar districts showed more than 100 cases and Kulgam and Kathua districts showed strong growth of the number of cases from the beginning of May, without a tendency to normalization. The estimated R0 for the J&K region was 1.041; but by decreasing the RO by 10, 25, and 50%, we observed a great decrease in the daily number of new cases, especially by decreasing by 50%.

We aimed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on IBD patient care from health care providers’ (HCP) and patients’ perspectives. Methods We administered a 42-question HCP survey and a 44-question patient survey, which evaluated HCP and patient experience and satisfaction with care delivery and delays in access to IBD care during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results Surveys were completed by 19.2% (24/125) HCPs and 25.8% (408/1581) patients. Overall, 82.7% of patients with IBD maintained their care without disruption. The majority of patients were satisfied with a transition to virtual care. All HCPs were willing to use virtual care in the future;however, 60% (14/24) of HCPs reported that virtual care was not equivalent to in-person visits. Patients reported concerns around access to health resources, the uncertainty of IBD-specific care, and fear and stress due to employment uncertainty and safety. Providers also reported concerns about patient safety, patient education, adequate remuneration and challenges with providing care for new patients on virtual platforms. Conclusion While some delays in health care delivery occurred during the first wave of the pandemic, both patients and HCPs were satisfied with a transition to new models of care delivery. These models may remain in place post-pandemic and allow for flexibility in care delivery that is acceptable to both patients and HCPs.",,"Dahiya, Monica Olayinka Lily Kaplan Gilaad G.; Reeb, Leanne Ma Christopher Panaccione Remo Kroeker Karen I.",Journal of the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology,,246486015.0,,248
nn3vfxw8,WHO,Stroke Acute Management and Outcomes During the COVID-19 Outbreak: A Cohort Study From the Madrid Stroke Network,,unk,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has added challenges to providing quality acute stroke care due to the reallocation of stroke resources to COVID-19. Case series suggest that patients with COVID-19 have more severe strokes; however, no large series have compared stroke outcomes with contemporary non-COVID-19 patients. Purpose was to analyze the impact of COVID-19 pandemic in stroke care and to evaluate stroke outcomes according to the diagnosis of COVID-19. METHODS: Retrospective multicenter cohort study including consecutive acute stroke patients admitted to 7 stroke centers from February 25 to April 25, 2020 (first 2 months of the COVID-19 outbreak in Madrid). The quality of stroke care was measured by the number of admissions, recanalization treatments, and time metrics. The primary outcome was death or dependence at discharge. RESULTS: A total of 550 acute stroke patients were admitted. A significant reduction in the number of admissions and secondary interhospital transfers was found. COVID-19 was confirmed in 105 (19.1%) patients, and a further 19 patients were managed as suspected COVID-19 (3.5%). No differences were found in the rates of reperfusion therapies in ischemic strokes (45.5% non-COVID-19, 35.7% confirmed COVID-19, and 40% suspected COVID-19; P=0.265). However, the COVID-19 group had longer median door-to-puncture time (110 versus 80 minutes), which was associated with the performance of chest computed tomography. Multivariate analysis confirmed poorer outcomes for confirmed or suspected COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratios, 2.05 [95% CI, 1.12-3.76] and 3.56 [95% CI, 1.15-11.05], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that patients with COVID-19 have more severe strokes and poorer outcomes despite similar acute management. A well-established stroke care network helps to diminish the impact of such an outbreak in stroke care, reducing secondary transfers and allowing maintenance of reperfusion therapies, with a minor impact on door-to-puncture times, which were longer in patients who underwent chest computed tomography.",,"Fuentes, Blanca; Alonso de Leciñana, María; García-Madrona, Sebastián; Díaz-Otero, Fernando; Aguirre, Clara; Calleja, Patricia; Egido, José A; Carneado-Ruiz, Joaquín; Ruiz-Ares, Gerardo; Rodríguez-Pardo, Jorge; Rodríguez-López, Ángela; Ximénez-Carrillo, Álvaro; de Felipe, Alicia; Ostos, Fernando; González-Ortega, Guillermo; Simal, Patricia; Gómez Escalonilla, Carlos I; Gómez-Porro-Sánchez, Pablo; Desanvicente, Zayrho; Reig, Gemma; Gil-Núñez, Antonio; Masjuán, Jaime; Díez-Tejedor, Exuperio",Stroke,,230822366.0,,303

Research Question Does the rate of VTE among adults hospitalized with Covid-19 differ from matched hospitalized controls without Covid-19? Study Design and Methods We conducted a retrospective study among hospitalized adults with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 and hospitalized adults without evidence of Covid-19 matched on age, gender, race/ethnicity, acute illness severity, and month of hospitalization between February-August 2020 from two integrated healthcare delivery systems with 36 hospitals. Outcomes included VTE (deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ascertained using diagnosis codes combined with validated natural language processing algorithms applied to electronic health records) and death from any cause at 30 days. Fine and Gray hazards regression was performed to evaluate the association of Covid-19 with VTE after accounting for competing risk of death and residual differences between groups, as well as identifying predictors of VTE in patients with Covid-19.

In the past few years, new telecommunication-based practices, including various forms of e-rehabilitation have gained attention all over the world, including the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Telerehabilitation is an alternative way of delivering rehabilitation services in which information and communication technologies are used to expedite communication between the health care professional and the patient at a distant location. It can be beneficial to people in rural areas, especially individuals in isolated communities. At present, the COVID-19 pandemic has forced speedy adoption of telerehabilitation due to restricted traditional in-person visits all over the world, including KSA; however, no telerehabilitation guidelines are available in the country. Since specialized rehabilitation services are limited to main cities of the country, the provision of care by reaching out the underserved areas using telemedicine technology is deemed important. These guidelines were established collaboratively by panel of various rehabilitation experts with input from other practitioners in the field and strategic stakeholders. It will facilitate rehabilitation clinicians practicing in KSA providing consultation, counseling, education, assessment, monitoring, therapy, or follow-up to a patient remotely using telemedicine communication technologies. This document includes administrative, clinical, and technical guidelines, which are aimed to standardize telerehabilitation practice across the country.

wojdthiy,Medline,Effects of total fat intake on bodyweight in children.,10.1002/14651858.cd012960.pub2,unk,"BACKGROUND As part of efforts to prevent childhood overweight and obesity, we need to understand the relationship between total fat intake and body fatness in generally healthy children. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects and associations of total fat intake on measures of weight and body fatness in children and young people not aiming to lose weight. SEARCH METHODS For this update we revised the previous search strategy and ran it over all years in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (Ovid), MEDLINE (PubMed), and Embase (Ovid) (current to 23 May 2017). No language and publication status limits were applied. We searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing and unpublished studies (5 June 2017). SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in children aged 24 months to 18 years, with or without risk factors for cardiovascular disease, randomised to a lower fat (30% or less of total energy (TE)) versus usual or moderate-fat diet (greater than 30%TE), without the intention to reduce weight, and assessed a measure of weight or body fatness after at least six months. We included prospective cohort studies if they related baseline total fat intake to weight or body fatness at least 12 months later. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We extracted data on participants, interventions or exposures, controls and outcomes, and trial or cohort quality characteristics, as well as data on potential effect modifiers, and assessed risk of bias for all included studies. We extracted body weight and blood lipid levels outcomes at six months, six to 12 months, one to two years, two to five years and more than five years for RCTs; and for cohort studies, at baseline to one year, one to two years, two to five years, five to 10 years and more than 10 years. We planned to perform random-effects meta-analyses with relevant subgrouping, and sensitivity and funnel plot analyses where data allowed. MAIN RESULTS We included 24 studies comprising three parallel-group RCTs (n = 1054 randomised) and 21 prospective analytical cohort studies (about 25,059 children completed). Twenty-three studies were conducted in high-income countries. No meta-analyses were possible, since only one RCT reported the same outcome at each time point range for all outcomes, and cohort studies were too heterogeneous to combine.Effects of dietary counselling to reduce total fat intake from RCTsTwo studies recruited children aged between 4 and 11 years and a third recruited children aged 12 to 13 years. Interventions were combinations of individual and group counselling, and education sessions in clinics, schools and homes, delivered by dieticians, nutritionists, behaviourists or trained, supervised teachers. Concerns about imprecision and poor reporting limited our confidence in our findings. In addition, the inclusion of hypercholesteraemic children in two trials raised concerns about applicability.One study of dietary counselling to lower total fat intake found that the intervention may make little or no difference to weight compared with usual diet at 12 months (mean difference (MD) -0.50 kg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.78 to 0.78; n = 620; low-quality evidence) and at three years (MD -0.60 kg, 95% CI -2.39 to 1.19; n = 612; low-quality evidence). Education delivered as a classroom curriculum probably decreased BMI in children at 17 months (MD -1.5 kg/m2, 95% CI -2.45 to -0.55; 1 RCT; n = 191; moderate-quality evidence). The effects were smaller at longer term follow-up (five years: MD 0 kg/m2, 95% CI -0.63 to 0.63; n = 541; seven years; MD -0.10 kg/m2, 95% CI -0.75 to 0.55; n = 576; low-quality evidence).Dietary counselling probably slightly reduced total cholesterol at 12 months compared to controls (MD -0.15 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.24 to -0.06; 1 RCT; n = 618; moderate-quality evidence), but may make little or no difference over longer time periods. Dietary counselling probably slightly decreased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol at 12 months (MD -0.12 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.20 to -0.04; 1 RCT; n = 618, moderate-quality evidence) and at five years (MD -0.09, 95% CI -0.17 to -0.01; 1 RCT; n = 623; moderate-quality evidence), compared to controls. Dietary counselling probably made little or no difference to HDL-C at 12 months (MD -0.03 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.02; 1 RCT; n = 618; moderate-quality evidence), and at five years (MD -0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.04; 1 RCT; n = 522; moderate-quality evidence). Likewise, counselling probably made little or no difference to triglycerides in children at 12 months (MD -0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.06; 1 RCT; n = 618; moderate-quality evidence). Lower versus usual or modified fat intake may make little or no difference to height at seven years (MD -0.60 cm, 95% CI -2.06 to 0.86; 1 RCT; n = 577; low-quality evidence).Associations between total fat intake, weight and body fatness from cohort studiesOver half the cohort analyses that reported on primary outcomes suggested that as total fat intake increases, body fatness measures may move in the same direction. However, heterogeneous methods and reporting across cohort studies, and predominantly very low-quality evidence, made it difficult to draw firm conclusions and true relationships may be substantially different. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS We were unable to reach firm conclusions.

We evaluated the optimal location for placement of a cerebral oximeter probe while avoiding the frontal sinus in pediatric patients. This retrospective observational study included 203 pediatric patients aged 3-17 years who had undergone brain computed tomography from November 2010 to December 2015. The patients were divided into five subgroups based on their age. The frontal sinus height was measured from the superior orbital rim. Pneumatization of the frontal sinus was not visible in 78% (3-5 years) and 22% (6-8 years) of the patients. The mean (SD) of the frontal sinus height was 5.9 (3.4), 9.5 (4.1), 14.0 (6.2) 18.6 (8.4), and 21.1 (7.9) mm in the 3-5, 6-8, 9-11, 12-14, and 15-17 year age-groups, respectively.

METHODS: Residents (aged 18-80 years) of Central and South Auckland hospitalized for World Health Organization-defined severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) (2012-2015) underwent influenza virus polymerase chain reaction testing. The CMC statuses for Auckland residents were modeled using hospitalization International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes, pharmaceutical claims, and laboratory results. Population-level influenza rates in adults with congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), cerebrovascular accidents (CVA), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, diabetes mellitus (DM), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) were calculated by Poisson regression stratified by age and adjusted for ethnicity. RESULTS: Among 891 276 adults, 2435 influenza-associated SARI hospitalizations occurred.

Although often overlooked, dysfunction of these special senses may have broad implications on multiple facets of patients' lives -including safety, nutritional status, quality of life, mental health, and even cognitive function. As ""loss of smell or taste"" emerged as a common symptom of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the importance of intact chemosensory function has been thrust into the spotlight. Despite the growing recognition of chemosensory dysfunction, this already highly prevalent condition will increasingly impact a larger and more diverse population, highlighting the need for improved awareness and care of these patients. METHODS: Comtemporary review of chemosensory function and assessments. CONCLUSIONS: Although patient-reported chemosensory function measures highlight the ease of screening of chemosensory dysfunction, self-reported measures underestimate both the prevalence and degree of chemosensory dysfunction and do not adequately distinguish between olfaction, gustation, and chemesthesis. Meanwhile, psychophysical assessment tools provide opportunities for more accurate, thorough assessment of the chemosenses when appropriate. Primary care providers are uniquely situated to identify patients burdened by chemosensory dysfunction and raise patient and provider awareness about the importance of chemosensory dysfunction. Identification of chemosensory dysfunction, particularly olfactory dysfunction, may raise suspicion for many underlying medical conditions, including early detection of neurodegenerative conditions. Furthermore, identification and awareness of patients with chemosensory dysfunction may help primary care providers to identify those who may benefit from additional therapeutic and safety interventions, or consultations with specialists for more detailed evaluations and management.",,"Claus, Lauren E; Leland, Evelyn M; Tai, Katherine Y; Schlosser, Rodney J; Kamath, Vidyulata; Lane, Andrew P; Rowan, Nicholas R",J Am Board Fam Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35379730/; https://doi.org/10.3122/jabfm.2022.02.210373,247941233.0,,254

This study aimed to develop ""do-it-yourself"" face masks and test the effectiveness of banana leaf-filtered cloth face masks. The design development was conducted by a series of trials for making a mask pattern that can be applied to the cloth. Then, we performed bacterial filtration efficiency (BFE) and water resistance tests to investigate the effectiveness of banana leaf-filtered cloth-based face masks. The dimensions of the developed face mask are 20x18 cm, with a semi-duckbill model, consisting of three layers of washable cotton cloth and a pocket designed for the banana leaf filter.

Even if vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 infection is becoming increasingly available, a more feasible approach for COVID-19 prevention and therapy is still needed. Evidence of a pathological link between metabolic diseases and severe forms of COVID-19 has stimulated critical reflection and new considerations. In particular, an abnormal immune response observed in certain patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection suggested possible common predisposing risk factors with autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). Correct supplementation with dietary factors may be key to preventing and counteracting both the underlying metabolic impairment and the complications of COVID-19. A set of agents may inhibit the cytokine storm and hypercoagulability that characterize severe COVID-19 infection: vitamin D3, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, polyphenols like pterostilbene, polydatin and honokiol, which can activate anti-inflammatory and antioxidant sirtuins pathways, quercetin, vitamin C, zinc, melatonin, lactoferrin and glutathione. These agents could be highly beneficial for subjects who have altered immune responses.

Oxidative stress is known to influence FSHD muscle tissue. One hundred and ninety-eight genetically confirmed FSHD patients completed a questionnaire from which the number of packyears of smoking and the lifetime cumulative alcohol units consumed were calculated.

chy7096f,PMC,Structural basis of West Nile virus neutralization by a therapeutic antibody,10.1038/nature03956,no-cc,"West Nile virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus closely related to the human epidemic-causing dengue, yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis viruses(1). In establishing infection these icosahedral viruses undergo endosomal membrane fusion catalysed by envelope glycoprotein rearrangement of the putative receptor-binding domain III (DIII) and exposure of the hydrophobic fusion loop(2,3,4). Humoral immunity has an essential protective function early in the course of West Nile virus infection(5,6). Here, we investigate the mechanism of neutralization by the E16 monoclonal antibody that specifically binds DIII. Structurally, the E16 antibody Fab fragment engages 16 residues positioned on four loops of DIII, a consensus neutralizing epitope sequence conserved in West Nile virus and distinct in other flaviviruses. The E16 epitope protrudes from the surface of mature virions in three distinct environments(7), and docking studies predict Fab binding will leave five-fold clustered epitopes exposed. We also show that E16 inhibits infection primarily at a step after viral attachment, potentially by blocking envelope glycoprotein conformational changes. Collectively, our results suggest that a vaccine strategy targeting the dominant DIII epitope may elicit safe and effective immune responses against flaviviral diseases.

Several strategies were implemented to combat COVID-19, including wearing masks, hand hygiene, and social distancing. The impact of these strategies on COVID-19 and other viral infections remains largely unclear. OBJECTIVE: We aim to investigate the impact of implemented infectious control strategies on the incidences of influenza, enterovirus infection, and all-cause pneumonia during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We utilized the electronic database of the Taiwan National Infectious Disease Statistics System and extracted incidences of COVID-19, influenza virus, enterovirus, and all-cause pneumonia. We compared the incidences of these diseases from week 45 of 2016 to week 21 of 2020 and performed linear regression analyses. RESULTS: The first case of COVID-19 in Taiwan was reported in late January 2020 (week 4). Infectious control strategies have been promoted since late January. The influenza virus usually peaks in winter and decreases around week 14. However, a significant decrease in influenza was observed after week 6 of 2020. Regression analyses produced the following results: 2017, R2=0.037; 2018, R2=0.021; 2019, R2=0.046; and 2020, R2=0.599. A dramatic decrease in all-cause pneumonia was also reported (R2 values for 2017-2020 were 0.435, 0.098, 0.352, and 0.82, respectively). Enterovirus had increased by week 18 in 2017-2019, but this was not observed in 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Using this national epidemiological database, we found a significant decrease in cases of influenza, enterovirus, and all-cause pneumonia during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We investigated whether Vo2pk and systemic responses measured during field walking tests were similar to those measured during an incremental treadmill test (ITMT) in obese individuals with treated OSA. METHODS Individuals with treated OSA and a BMI > 30 kg/m2 were recruited. Participants completed an ITMT, two 6-min walk tests (6MWTs), and two incremental shuttle walk tests (ISWTs) on three separate days in a randomized order. Expired gas analysis was performed during all tests. RESULTS The study was completed by 16 patients (nine men) (mean [SD] age, 58 [12] y; BMI, 36.1 [7.6] kg/m2). There was no difference (P = .27) in Vo2pk assessed by the ITMT and the ISWT (2,266 [478] and 2,017 [561] mL/min, respectively). The Vo2pk measured by the 6MWT (1,778 [360] mL/min) was lower than that measured by the ITMT (P < .01). The limits of agreement for Vo2pk between the ISWT and the ITM were ± 730 mL/min. Cardiorespiratory responses during the ISWT and the ITMT reflected a graded response to a peak, whereas the 6MWT demonstrated a rapid rise to a plateau. CONCLUSIONS The ISWT can be used instead of an ITMT and in preference to the 6MWT to assess cardiorespiratory fitness for a cohort of obese people with treated OSA. However, the imprecision of the agreement in Vo2pk between the ITMT and ISWT means they cannot be used interchangeably in an individual.

Drug combinations have been also tested to treat other infectious diseases, including the recentcoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. To simplify administration fixed-dose combinationshave been introduced, however, oral anti-HIV therapy still struggles with low oral bioavailability of many ARVs.This work investigated the co-encapsulation of two clinically relevant ARV combinations,tipranavir (TPV):efavirenz (EFV) anddarunavir (DRV):efavirenz (EFV):ritonavir (RTV),within the core of ß-casein (bCN) micelles. Encapsulation efficiency in both systems was ~100%. Cryo-transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering of the ARV-loaded colloidaldispersions indicatefull preservation of the spherical morphology, and x-ray diffraction confirm that the encapsulated drugs are amorphous. To prolong the physicochemical stabilitythe formulations were freeze-driedwithout cryo/lyoprotectant, and successfully redispersed, with minor changes in morphology.Then, theARV-loaded micelles were encapsulated within microparticles of Eudragit® L100, which prevented enzymatic degradation and minimized drug release under gastric-like pH conditionsin vitro.

METHODS: A total of 117 samples from 30 patients with confirmed COVID-19 and 61 patients without COVID-19 were collected. Reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) were used for qualitative and quantitative analyses of these samples to evaluate the diagnostic performance and applicability of the two methods. RESULTS: The positive detection rates of RT-qPCR and ddPCR were 93.3% and 100%, respectively. Among the 117 samples, 6 samples were tested single-gene positive by RT-qPCR but positive by ddPCR, and 3 samples were tested negative by RT-qPCR but positive by ddPCR. The viral load of samples with inconsistent results were relatively low (3.1-20.5 copies/test). There were 17 samples (37%) with a viral load below 20 copies/test among the 46 positive samples, and only 9 of them were successfully detected by RT-qPCR. A severe patient was dynamically monitored. All 6 samples from this patient were tested negative by RT-qPCR, but 4 samples were tested positive by ddPCR with a low viral load. CONCLUSION: Qualitative analysis of COVID-19 samples can meet the needs of clinical screening and diagnosis, while quantitative analysis provides more information to the research community. Although both ddPCR and RT-qPCR can provide qualitative and quantitative results, ddPCR showed higher sensitivity and lower limit of detection than RT-qPCR, and it does not rely on the standard curve to quantify viral load. Therefore, ddPCR offers greater advantages than RT-qPCR.",,"Dang, Yan; Liu, Ning; Tan, Chianru; Feng, Yingmei; Yuan, Xingxing; Fan, Dongdong; Peng, Yanke; Jin, Ronghua; Guo, Yong; Lou, Jinli",Clin Chim Acta,,221298698.0,,258

Because these products do not require the oversight of a physician or pharmacist, labeling plays a key role in communicating information required for their safe and effective use. Research suggests that current labels are not terribly effective at communicating potential risk. One reason for their lack of effectiveness is that few consumers attend to critical information (active ingredients and warnings) when making purchases. In two experiments, we used a change detection task to objectively evaluate how novel label designs that employ highlighting and a warning label placed on the package’s front impact attention to critical information among older participants (65 and older). The change detection task is a unique form of visual search which allowed us to assess the attentional priority of critical information among participants who were not explicitly instructed to search for this critical information. This unique aspect of the task is important given research suggesting that consumers rarely have the explicit goal of seeking out warnings and active ingredients when making OTC selections. Our results provide empirical support that both highlighting critical information and positioning it on the package’s front increase its attentional prioritization relative to current, commercial practice. Given that attending to the critical information is prerequisite to utilizing that information, strategies that elicit attention in this way are likely to reduce medication errors.",2021-05-26,"Harben, Alyssa L.; Kashy, Deborah A.; Esfahanian, Shiva; Liu, Lanqing; Bix, Laura; Becker, Mark W.",Cogn Res Princ Implic,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34041617/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s41235-021-00307-z,235205449.0,2021.0,240

We sought to determine whether primary fascial closure and/or overlap of the mesh reduced recurrence and/or complications. We conducted a retrospective review on 57 LAVHR patients using polyester composite mesh between August 2010 and July 2013. They were divided into mesh-only (nonclosure) and primary fascial closure with mesh (closure) groups. Patient demographics, prior surgical history, mesh overlap, complications, and recurrence rates were compared. Thirty-nine (68%) of 57 patients were in the closure group and 18 (32%) in the nonclosure group. Mean defect sizes were 15.5 and 22.5 cm(2), respectively. Participants were followed for a mean of 1.3 years [standard deviation (SD) = 0.7]. Recurrence rates were 2/39 (5.1%) in the closure group and 1/18 (5.6%) in the nonclosure group (P = 0.947). There were no major postoperative complications in the nonclosure group. The closure group experienced four (10.3%) complications. This was not a statistically significant difference (P = 0.159). The median mesh-to-hernia ratio for all repairs was 15.2 (surface area) and 3.9 (diameter). Median length of stay was 14.5 hours (1.7-99.3) for patients with nonclosure and 11.9 hours (6.9-90.3 hours) for patients with closure (P = 0.625). In conclusion, this is one of the largest series of LAVHR exclusively using polyester dual-sided mesh. Our recurrence rate was about 5 per cent. Significant mesh overlap is needed to achieve such low recurrence rates.

To guide public health policies, we aimed to describe the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in the general population in Kinshasa. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, household-based serosurvey between October 22, 2020, and November 8, 2020. Participants were interviewed at home and tested for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins in a Luminex based assay. A positive serology was defined as a sample that reacted with both SARS-CoV-2 proteins (100% sensitivity, 99.7% specificity). The overall weighted, age-standardized prevalence was estimated and the infection-to-case ratio was calculated to determine the proportion of undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infections. RESULTS: A total of 1233 participants from 292 households were included (mean age, 32.4 years; 764 [61.2%] were women). The overall weighted, age-standardized SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was 16.6% (95% CI 14.0-19.5). The estimated infection-to-case ratio was 292:1.

The commonest symptoms of COVID-19 disease are fever, cough, anosmia, and lymphocytopenia. However, other apparently less common clinical symptoms have been described, including skin lesions. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate skin involvement in COVID-19. METHODS: The authors performed a systematic review of literature, in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). The search was reiterated until May 06, 2020. RESULTS: Overall, 1593 patients (M/F ratio: 1 : 9) with suspect of COVID-19 were examined. The mean age was 37.8 (range 0-91) years. Among the analyzed patients, 84 (5.3%) were pediatrics (<18 years). Chilblains are very common among skin lesions and represent almost half of all skin lesions reported (46%); in 75% of patients with cutaneous manifestation, the latter presented before other typical clinical manifestation of COVID-19. Vasculitis or thrombosis was identified in almost 70% of patients who suffered from skin manifestations. CONCLUSION: The present study highlights the importance of skin involvement in COVID-19.

MAIN FINDINGS Ophthalmologists have been largely impacted by the COVID-19 sanitary crisis, due to both the ocular manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 and to the high contagiousness of the virus. The proximity of ophthalmologists to their patients have pushed eye-care providers to readapt their practices and develop alternatives to face-to-face consultations. However, teleconsultation has some major limitations and drawbacks, especially for ocular surface assessment that relies on high-quality graphic data for adequate diagnosis. Tele-screening, on the other hand, emphasizes on the importance of history-taking and listening to the patient in order to adequately prioritize appointments based on the presumed degree of emergency. CONCLUSION Despite all the enthusiasm, tele-screening as currently performed with the available tools is still not capable of completely replacing a standard ophthalmic examination for the assessment of ocular surface diseases.

Children have been noted to have less severe illness than adults and may have less transmission potential. We sought to determine whether children deemed to be asymptomatic had a difference in the PCR cycle threshold (Ct) value of respiratory samples from symptomatic children with SARS CoV-2 infection. METHODS: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study to compare PCR Ct values of 728 children who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by respiratory samples collected over a 4-month period. The study was a single center review of patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR from a respiratory specimen at a large tertiary care children’s hospital. Inclusion criteria included children 0–18 years of age who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR from a respiratory specimen for whom clinical information was available in the electronic medical record. RESULTS: We analyzed 728 children who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR from a respiratory sample over a 4-month period and for whom data was available in the electronic medical record. Overall, 71.2% of infected children were symptomatic. The mean Ct value for symptomatic patients (Ct mean 19.9, SD 6.3) was significantly lower than asymptomatic patients (Ct mean 23.5, SD 6.5) (P value < 0.001, CI(95th) 2.6 - 4.6). The mean PCR Ct value was lowest in children less than 5 years of age.

METHODS: Through Swedish nationwide multiregister linkages, we selected all adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA, n=53 455 in March 2020), other IJDs (here: spondyloarthropathies, psoriatic arthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis, n=57 112), their antirheumatic drug use, and individually matched population referents. We compared annual all-cause mortality March–September 2015 through 2020 within and across cohorts, and assessed absolute and relative risks for hospitalisation, admission to intensive care and death due to COVID-19 March–September 2020, using Cox regression. RESULTS: During March–September 2020, the absolute all-cause mortality in RA and in other IJDs was higher than 2015–2019, but relative risks versus the general population (around 2 and 1.5) remained similar during 2020 compared with 2015–2019. Among patients with IJD, the risks of hospitalisation (0.5% vs 0.3% in their population referents), admission to intensive care (0.04% vs 0.03%) and death (0.10% vs 0.07%) due to COVID-19 were low. Antirheumatic drugs were not associated with increased risk of serious COVID-19 outcomes, although for certain drugs, precision was limited. CONCLUSIONS: Risks of severe COVID-19-related outcomes were increased among patients with IJDs, but risk increases were also seen for non-COVID-19 morbidity.

Here, by using structural and phylogenetic analyses and site-directed mutagenesis, we identified a residue (Cys440 in Nicotiana tabacum 5-epi-aristolochene synthase) proximal to an ion-binding motif common to all TPSs and named the preNSE/DTE residue, which determines the product specificity of sesquiterpene synthases from different plant species. In sesquiterpene synthases catalyzing 1,10-cyclization (1,10-cyclases) of farnesyl diphosphate, mutation of the residue in both specific and promiscuous 1,10-cyclases from different lineages leads to the accumulation of monocyclic germacrene A-11-ol, which is ""short-circuited"" from complex cyclization cascades, suggesting a key role of this residue in generating the first common intermediate of 1,10-cyclization. Altering this residue in a specific 1,11-cyclase results in alternative 1,10-cyclization products.

We explore the expression profiles of SARS-CoV-2 host genes, their population variations, associated genetic variants, age- and sex-dependency in normal individuals. SARS-CoV-2 host genes are provisionally defined as the human genes that are experimentally validated or bioinformatically predicted to interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Genes exhibiting most variable expression include ACE2, CLEC4G, CLEC4M, CD209 (interact with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein); REEP6 (a receptor accessory protein expressed in the olfactory epithelium); SLC27A2 and PKP2 (inhibit virus replication); and PTGS2 (mediates fever response). SNP rs4804803, associated with SARS severity, affects expression of CLEC4G and CD209. Genetic variants of proteases associated with SARS-CoV-2 entry (TMPRSS2, CTSB, and CTSL) are strongly associated with their expression variation, suggesting a genetic contribution to phenotypic variations in multiple organs upon virus attack. The most significant age-dependent gene is ACE2, the cellular receptor of SARS-CoV-2. Others include TGF-β family member GDF15, mediating inflammation, and VKORC1, possibly explaining vitamin K deficiency in COVID-19. TIMM10 and ERGIC1 exhibit significant sex differences.

Activation of pattern recognition receptors, in combination with inflammatory cytokine-induced signaling through death domain-containing receptors, initiates a highly interconnected cell death process called PANoptosis (pyroptosis, apoptosis, necroptosis). Broadly speaking, PANoptosis is critical for restricting a wide range of pathogens (including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites), which we describe in this review.

Then, some correctness properties of these systems can be checked using model finders, which compute sample scenarios either fulfilling the desired properties or illustrating potential faults. Such scenarios allow designers to validate, verify and test the system under development. Nevertheless, when asked to produce several scenarios, model finders tend to produce similar solutions. This lack of diversity impairs their effectiveness as testing or validation assets. To solve this problem, we propose the use of graph kernels, a family of methods for computing the (dis)similarity among pairs of graphs. With this metric, it is possible to cluster scenarios effectively, improving the usability of model finders and making testing and validation more efficient.",2020-04-22,"Clarisó, Robert; Cabot, Jordi",Rigorous State-Based Methods,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7242039/,,2020.0,125

However, comparatively little is known about the interplay between RNAi and various viral infections in mammalian hosts. We show in the present study that the siRNA-mediated silencing of Drosha, Dicer and Ago2 [argonaute RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex) catalytic component 2] transcripts in Huh7 cells resulted in elevated levels of HBV (hepatitis B virus)-specific RNAs and, conversely, we observed a decrease in mRNA and protein levels of same RNAi components in HepG2 cells infected with HBV. Similar reductions were also detectable in CHB (chronic hepatitis B) patients. Analysis of CHB liver biopsy samples, with high serum HBV DNA load (>log108 IU/ml), revealed a reduced mRNA and protein levels of Drosha, Dicer and Ago2. The low expression levels of key RNAi pathway components in CHB patient samples as well as hepatic cells established a link between HBV replication and RNAi components. The HBV proteins were also examined for RSS (RNA-silencing suppressor) properties. Using GFP-based reversion of silencing assays, in the present study we found that HBx is an RSS protein. Through a series of deletions and substitution mutants, we found that the full-length HBx protein is required for optimum RSS activity. The in vitro dicing assays revealed that the HBx protein inhibited the human Dicer-mediated processing of dsRNAs into siRNAs. Together, our results suggest that the HBx protein might function as RSS to manipulate host RNAi defence, in particular by abrogating the function of Dicer. The present study may have implications in the development of newer strategies to combat HBV infection.",,"Chinnappan, Mahendran; Singh, Avishek Kumar; Kakumani, Pavan Kumar; Kumar, Gautam; Rooge, Sheetalnath Babasaheb; Kumari, Anupama; Varshney, Aditi; Rastogi, Archana; Singh, Ashok Kumar; Sarin, Shiv Kumar; Malhotra, Pawan; Mukherjee, Sunil Kumar; Bhatnagar, Raj Kamal",The Biochemical journal,https://doi.org/10.1042/bj20140316; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24902849/,10213217.0,,263

The answer is no, but",,unk,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To search for evidence on whether having asthma increases the risk of poor outcomes of COVID-19 and report on recommendations on optimal asthma management in times of COVID-19. RECENT FINDINGS: Patients with asthma are neither at greater risk of becoming infected by SARS-CoV-2 nor they are at risk of complications of COVID-19 but those requiring frequent use of oral corticosteroid may be at greater risk. SUMMARY: In general, patients with asthma are not at risk of COVID-19 morbidity or mortality. On the contrary, patients with asthma may be at lower risk of hospitalizations during the COVID-19 pandemic. This may be related to asthma and its treatment, to patient's behavior, to the health system, and to collective changes in activities. It is likely that reduction in respiratory infections because of social distancing, face masks, and hand washing have a role in the reduction in asthma hospitalizations. Management of asthma in times of COVID-19 must be optimized, medication have to be used regularly and exacerbations detected early. Systemic corticosteroids may be used for control of severe asthma or severe exacerbations.

We call this dual digitalization, which has been an obstacle for digital transformation of the sector, and made it challenging to develop a shared digital space. Our research question is, how can we develop a shared digital learning space in higher education? We conducted our study at the University of Oslo, where we analyzed three phases of digitalization. We identified three underlying forces of the digital learning space. First, the alignment of digital education and digital subjects provided a technical foundation.

echu0zmf,Medline; PMC,Modern approaches to understanding stress and disease susceptibility: A review with special emphasis on respiratory disease,,no-cc,"Studies in animals and humans link both physical and psychological stress with an increased incidence and severity of respiratory infections. For this manuscript we define stress as the physiological responses an individual undergoes while adjusting to a continually changing environment. It is known that stressors of various types (psychological/physical) can alter the physiological levels of certain hormones, chemokines and cytokines. These alterations send information to the central nervous system to take necessary action which then sends messages to appropriate organs/tissues/cells to respond. These messages can either activate or suppress the immune system as needed and failure to compensate for this by the body can lead to serious health-related problems. Little is known how stress affects disease susceptibility, yet understanding this mechanism is important for developing effective treatments, and for improving health and food quality. The current review focuses on (a) the effects of psychological stressors in humans and animals, (b) various methodologies employed to understand stress responses and their outcomes, and (c) the current status of the attempts to correlate stress and disease with respiratory disease as model system. The methodologies included in this review span traditional epidemiological, behavioral and immunological studies to current high throughput genomic, proteomic, metabolomic/metabonomic approaches. With the advent of various newer omics and bioinformatics methodologies we postulate that it will become feasible to understand the mechanisms through which stress can influence disease onset. Although the literature in this area is limited because of the infancy of this research area, the objective of this review is to illustrate the power of new approaches to address complex biological questions. These new approaches will also aid in our understanding how these processes are related to the dynamics and kinetics of changes in expression of multiple genes at various levels.",2009-07-30,"Aich, Palok; Potter, Andrew A; Griebel, Philip J",Int J Gen Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20360883/,3947468.0,2009.0,291
5zhhm4mn,Medline; PMC,The usefulness of NLP techniques for predicting peaks in firefighter interventions due to rare events,10.1007/s00521-022-06996-x,no-cc,"In some countries such as France, the number of operations assisted by firefighters has shown an almost linear increase over the years, contrary to their resource capacity. For this reason, predicting the number of interventions has become a necessity. Initially, time series models were developed with several types of qualitative and quantitative features, including the alert level of the bulletins, to predict the operational load. We realized that interventions related to human activities are quite predictable. However, the recognition of interventions due to rare events such as storms or floods needs more than quantitative meteorological data to be identified, since there are almost always zero cases. Thus, this work proposes the application of natural language processing techniques, namely long short-term memory, convolutional neural networks, FlauBERT, and CamemBERT to extract features from the texts of weather bulletins in order to recognize periods with peak interventions, where the intense workload of firefighters is caused by rare events. Four categories identified as Emergency Person Rescue, Total Person Rescue, interventions related to Heating, and Storm/Flood were our targets for the multilabel classification models developed. The results showed a remarkable accuracy of 80%, 86%, 92%, and 86% for Emergency Rescue People, Total Rescue People, Heating, and Storm/Flood, respectively.",2022-02-26,"Cerna, Selene; Guyeux, Christophe; Laiymani, David",Neural Comput Appl,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35250179/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00521-022-06996-x,247149765.0,2022.0,203

(i) The analyses on the subset of SARS-CoV-2 literature identified studies published prior to 2020 that have now proven highly instrumental in the development of various clusters of publications linked to SARS-CoV-2. In particular, the so-called sleeping beauties of the coronavirus literature with an awakening in 2020 were identified, i.e., previously published studies of this literature that had remained relatively unnoticed for several years but gained sudden traction in 2020 in the wake of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. (ii) The subset of 2020 SARS-CoV-2 articles is bibliographically distant from the rest of this literature published prior to 2020. Individual articles of the SARS-CoV-2 segment with a bridging role between the two bodies of articles (i.e., before and after 2020) are identifiable. (iii) Furthermore, the degree of bibliographic coupling within the 2020 SARS-CoV-2 cluster is much poorer compared to the cluster of articles published prior to 2020.

To explore an alternate way to determine activity of brachytherapy plaques. METHODS: The surface dose rates of 106Ru/106Rh plaque developed indigenously were measured by extrapolation chamber. To rule out possibility of any error in the activity distribution and quantity, same source was used in two different configurations namely planar and curved. EBT3 Gafchromic film was used for determination of uniformity in activity. Monte Carlo-based Codes EGSnrc and FLUKA were used to calculate dose rate in tissue, percentage depth dose and for determination of activity. Parameters and correction factors were estimated using simulations. RESULTS: The measured reference absorbed dose rates for planar and curved 106Ru/106Rh eye plaques are found to be 589 ± 29 mGy/h and 560 ± 28 mGy/h, respectively. The difference in the reference absorbed dose rate of curved eye plaque is about ~5% as compared to planar configuration. The FLUKA-calculated dose values are almost independent of cavity length of the extrapolation chamber for both eye plaques. The FLUKA-based dose rates per µCi 106Ru/106Rh are about 17.28 ± 0.08 mGy/h and 16.48 ± 0.06 mGy/h, respectively for planar and curved eye plaques which match well with the measurements. The calculated activities for planar and curved eye plaques are 34.08 µCi and 33.98 µCi, respectively.

We investigated changes in depression and anxiety symptoms (overall and severe) from before to during the pandemic, as well as whether these changes are linked to COVID-19-related stressors and pre-existing vulnerabilities in young adults followed in the context of a population-based cohort. METHOD: Participants (n = 1039) from the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development reported on their depression (Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, short form) and anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder-7 Scale) symptoms and completed a COVID-19 questionnaire during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the summer of 2020 (age 22 years). Assessments at age 20 (2018) were used to estimate pre-pandemic depression and anxiety symptom severity. RESULTS: While mean levels of depression and anxiety symptoms did not change from before to during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., the mean of depressive symptoms was 9.30 in 2018 and 9.59 in 2020), we observed a slight increase in rates of severe depression (scores ≥ 21) from before (6.1%) to during (8.2%) the pandemic. Most COVID-19-related variables (e.g., loss of education/occupation, frequent news-seeking) – except living alone – and most pre-existing vulnerabilities (e.g., low SES, low social support) were not associated with changes in depression or anxiety symptoms. However, results varied as a function of pre-pandemic levels of depression and anxiety: depression and anxiety symptoms increased among adults with the lowest levels of symptoms before the pandemic, while they decreased among those with the highest levels of symptoms, possibly reflecting a regression to the mean. CONCLUSIONS: Depression and anxiety symptoms in young adults from Québec in Summer 2020 were mostly comparable to symptoms reported in 2018. Most COVID-19-related stressors and pre-existing vulnerabilities were not associated with changes in symptoms, except living alone and pre-existing symptoms of depression and anxiety. However, the increased rate of severe depression warrants further investigation.

90w4w5pz,ArXiv,Counting People by Estimating People Flows,,arxiv,"Modern methods for counting people in crowded scenes rely on deep networks to estimate people densities in individual images. As such, only very few take advantage of temporal consistency in video sequences, and those that do only impose weak smoothness constraints across consecutive frames. In this paper, we advocate estimating people flows across image locations between consecutive images and inferring the people densities from these flows instead of directly regressing them. This enables us to impose much stronger constraints encoding the conservation of the number of people. As a result, it significantly boosts performance without requiring a more complex architecture. Furthermore, it allows us to exploit the correlation between people flow and optical flow to further improve the results. We also show that leveraging people conservation constraints in both a spatial and temporal manner makes it possible to train a deep crowd counting model in an active learning setting with much fewer annotations. This significantly reduces the annotation cost while still leading to similar performance to the full supervision case.",2020-12-01,"Liu, Weizhe; Salzmann, Mathieu; Fua, Pascal",Unknown,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.00452v2.pdf,227239311.0,2020.0,170

This article aims to determine whether the daily variation of glucose is influenced by the use of corticosteroids in COVID-19 patients treated in Lima-Peru. METHODOLOGY: A prospective cohort study was undertook, in which glucose was measured four times a day in 53 patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. These values were associated with the use of corticosteroids and adjusted for other socio-educational variables, all by means of PA-GEE models. RESULTS: Nested multivariate analysis of daily glucose variation found that those using corticosteroids increased the daily average glucose as well as the first and last glucose measurements, this is, at 6am and 10pm, respectively (all p-values <0.026). An increase in glucose levels was also observed in those with diabetes (all p-values <0.001). In contrast, we found that there was a decrease in the last glucose measurement of the day in obese patients (p-value = 0.044).

Despite the numerous breast cancer therapeutic strategies, they either have limitations or sometimes are resisted by cancer, so new approaches are needed to tackle those restrictions. Nanotechnology offers exciting leaps in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, especially breast cancer. The main objective of this study was to investigate the effect of the newly synthesized gallium nanoparticles coated by Ellagic acid (EA-GaNPs) on the induced mammary gland carcinogenesis in female rats and their antibacterial activities comparison with standard antibiotics (Ketoconazole (100 µg/ml) and Gentamycin (4 µg/ml)) by disc diffusion method using eight different microbial species. The antitumor efficacy of EA-GaNPs was conducted both in vitro and in in vivo. The result of antimicrobial activity of EA-Ga NPs (1 mg/1 mL) revealed moderate toxicity behavior against Gram-positive {Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria {Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgarfs) also, antifungal activity was detected against {Aspergillus terreus). In vitro study showed that EA-GaNPs inhibited human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) proliferation with IC50 of 2.86 µg/ml. Although in vivo; the administration of EA-GaNPs to DMBA-treated rats ameliorated the hyperplastic state of mammary gland carcinogenesis induced by DMBA. Additionally, EA-GaNPs administration significantly modulated the activities of ALT and AST, as well as the levels of urea and creatinine in serum. Also, EA-GaNPs administration improved the antioxidant state by increasing Superoxide dismutase activity and GSH content, and decreasing malondialdehyde content in the mammary tissue, besides enhancing the apoptotic activity through elevating the levels of caspase-3 and decreasing the protein intensities of protein kinase B & phosphatidyl inositide 3-kinases. Furthermore, a significant decrease in serum Total iron-binding capacity accompanied by a significant increase in the level of calcium was noted. So, it can be concluded that the newly synthesized nanoparticles EA-GaNPs have an efficient antitumor activity that was manifested by reduction of the viability on the human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) in vitro. Also, in vivo against the chemically induced mammary gland carcinogenesis in a female rat model.

Our analysis finds that both policies and information on transmission risks are important determinants of Covid-19 cases and deaths and shows that a change in policies explains a large fraction of observed changes in social distancing behavior. Our main counterfactual experiments suggest that nationally mandating face masks for employees early in the pandemic could have reduced the weekly growth rate of cases and deaths by more than 10 percentage points in late April and could have led to as much as 19 to 47 percent less deaths nationally by the end of May, which roughly translates into 19 to 47 thousand saved lives. We also find that, without stay-at-home orders, cases would have been larger by 6 to 63 percent and without business closures, cases would have been larger by 17 to 78 percent. We find considerable uncertainty over the effects of school closures due to lack of cross-sectional variation; we could not robustly rule out either large or small effects. Overall, substantial declines in growth rates are attributable to private behavioral response, but policies played an important role as well. We also carry out sensitivity analyses to find neighborhoods of the models under which the results hold robustly: the results on mask policies appear to be much more robust than the results on business closures and stay-at-home orders.

The economic trend is modelled by an inverse function of GDPpc with a constant numerator which varies for the largest developed economies. In 2006, a statistical analysis conducted for 19 selected OECD countries for the period between 1950 and 2003 showed a very weak linear trend in the annual GDPpc increment for the largest economies: the USA, Japan, France, Italy, and Spain. The UK, Australia, and Canada showed a slightly steeper positive linear trend. The 2012 revision showed that the positive trends became much lower and some of them fell below zero due to the Great Recession. The fluctuations around the trend values are characterized by a quasi-normal distribution with heavy and asymmetric tails.

The lack of an effective method to control the endemics has led to a surge in PEDV recurrences in affected farms throughout the country. OBJECTIVES: In the first step toward establishing systematic monitoring of and active control measures over the swine populations, we constructed an assessment model that evaluates the status of (1) biosecurity, (2) herd immunity, and (3) virus circulation in each of the PEDV-infected farms. METHODS: A total of 13 farrow-to-finish pig farms with a history of acute PEDV infection on Jeju Island were chosen for this study. The potential risk of the recurrence in these farms was estimated through on-site data collection and laboratory examination. RESULTS: Overall, the data indicated that a considerable number of the PEDV-infected farms had lax biosecurity, achieved incomplete protective immunity in the sows despite multi-dose vaccination, and served as incubators of the circulating virus; thus, they face an increased risk of recurrent outbreaks. Intriguingly, our results suggest that after an outbreak, a farm requires proactive tasks, including reinforcing biosecurity, conducting serological and virus monitoring to check the sows’ immunity and to identify the animals exposed to PEDV, and improving the vaccination scheme and disinfection practices if needed.

There are a lot of organizations that prepare reports/indexes to reduce the impact of COVID-19 or to analyze the countries current situations for the outbreak. As one of the reports, the INFORM COVID-19 Risk Index is published by the European Commission to support prioritization of early response and preparedness activities of countries for the pandemic. In the index, 191 counties are evaluated based on more than 20 factors such as health conditions, hygiene, movements and etc. and each country is assigned to a risk class. However, the COVID-19 risk clusters of countries should be more sensitive that not be calculated with hard clustering methods. To overcome this issue, Fuzzy C-Means, K-Means, and K-Medoids clustering algorithms that has an advantage of robustness for vagueness and keeps much more knowledge than any hard clustering methods is applied to the data of INFORM COVID-19 Risk Index. Python is used for the application and obtained clustering results are compared with each other.

The impact of viral load in asymptomatic infected children is important to understand transmission potential. We sought to determine whether children deemed to be asymptomatic had a difference in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cycle threshold (Ct) value of respiratory samples from symptomatic children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study to compare PCR Ct values of children who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by respiratory samples collected over a 4-month period at a large tertiary care children’s hospital. RESULTS: We analyzed 728 children who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) from a respiratory sample over a 4-month period and for whom data were available in the electronic medical record. Overall, 71.2% of infected children were symptomatic. The mean Ct value for symptomatic patients (Ct mean, 19.9 [standard deviation, 6.3]) was significantly lower than for asymptomatic patients (Ct mean, 23.5 [standard deviation, 6.9]) (P < .001; 95% confidence interval, 2.6–4.6). The mean PCR Ct value was lowest in children <5 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective review of children who tested positive by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, the mean Ct was significantly lower in symptomatic children and was lowest in children <5 years of age, indicating that symptomatic children and younger children infected with SARS-CoV-2 may have a higher viral load in the nasopharynx compared to asymptomatic children.

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the advanced FETPs in the Eastern Mediterranean region (EMR) and ascertain whether the expected objectives of the programs are met. A descriptive study was conducted based on Kirkpatrick's model for evaluating training programs. Data were collected from FETP graduates and FETP technical advisers on the practices of FETP graduates, their engagement in key areas of field epidemiology, and their perceived skills and capacity to perform such activities. A total of 166 FETP graduates responded to the online survey. Almost two-thirds of FETP graduates reported that they are often engaged in managing public health surveillance systems (n = 119, 71.7%), analyzing the surveillance data (n = 116, 69.9%), training public health professionals (n = 113, 68.1%), investigations on and response to outbreaks (n = 109, 65.7%), and managing staff and resources (n = 106, 63.9%).

However, the management of these two conditions has rarely been discussed. We aimed to describe the clinical outcomes of pleural drainage in critically ill patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 17 pleural drainages were performed in 11 critically ill patients with pneumothorax or hydrothorax. Either chest tubes or central venous catheters (CVCs) were used. The clinical outcomes, including respiratory and circulation indicators at 24 h and 1 h before the procedure and 24 h and 48 h after the procedure, were retrospectively recorded. RESULTS: (1) Following pleural drainage, there was a 19.1% improvement in the PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio from 147.4 mmHg (-1 h) to 175.5 mmHg (24 h), while the mean positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) decreased from 10.7 cmH(2)O (-1 h) to 8.9 cmH(2)O (24 h) and 8.1 cmH(2)O (48 h). The A-a gradients decreased from 313.3 mmHg (-1 h) to 261.3 mmHg (24 h). (2) The dosage of norepinephrine increased from 0.15 μg/kg/min (-1 h) to 0.40 μg/kg/min (24 h). (3) No haemorrhagic or infectious complications were observed. (4) A total of 41.6% of CVCs were partially or fully obstructed, while no chest tubes were obstructed. CONCLUSION: For critically ill patients with COVID-19, pleural drainage leads to a significant improvement in oxygenation and gas exchange, but the deterioration of circulation is not reversed.

We also analyze structures for glycoforms representing those present in the nascent glycoproteins (prior to enzymatic modifications in the Golgi), as well as those that are commonly observed on antigens present in other viruses. These models were subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to determine the extent to which glycan microheterogeneity impacts the antigenicity of the S glycoprotein. Lastly, we have identified peptides in the S glycoprotein that are likely to be presented in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complexes, and discuss the role of S protein glycosylation in potentially modulating the adaptive immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus or to a related vaccine. The 3D structures show that the protein surface is extensively shielded from antibody recognition by glycans, with the exception of the ACE2 receptor binding domain, and also that the degree of shielding is largely insensitive to the specific glycoform.

The prospect of achieving this target relies on the understanding of China's energy growth pattern. To this end, we investigate the transformation of the growth pattern in China's energy consumption from 2005 to 2015. We combine environmental input-output approach and structural decomposition analysis to study the factors that influence the changes in China's energy consumption.

vgbqj5fe,Medline; PMC,Use of routine death and illness surveillance data to provide insight for UK pandemic planning: lessons from COVID-19,10.1136/bmjopen-2020-044707,cc-by,"OBJECTIVES: Reporting of COVID-19 cases, deaths and testing has often lacked context for appropriate assessment of disease burden within risk groups. The research considers how routine surveillance data might provide initial insights and identify risk factors, setting COVID-19 deaths early in the pandemic into context. This will facilitate the understanding of wider consequences of a pandemic from the earliest stage, reducing fear, aiding in accurately assessing disease burden and ensuring appropriate disease mitigation. SETTING: UK, 2020. PARTICIPANTS: The study is a secondary analysis of routine, public domain, surveillance data and information from Office for National Statistics (ONS), National Health Service (NHS) 111 and Public Health England (PHE) on deaths and disease. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Our principal focus is ONS data on deaths mentioning COVID-19 on the death certificate. We also consider information provided in NHS 111 and PHE data summaries. RESULTS: Deaths with COVID-19 significantly contributed to, yet do not entirely explain, abnormally elevated all-cause mortality in the UK from weeks 12–18 of 2020. Early in the UK epidemic, COVID-19 was the greatest threat to those with underlying illness, rarely endangering people aged under 40 years. COVID-19-related death rates differed by region, possibly reflecting underlying population structure. Risk of COVID-19-related death was greater for healthcare and social care staff and black, Asian and minority ethnic individuals, having allowed for documented risk factors. CONCLUSION: Early contextualisation of public health data is critical to recognising who gets sick, when and why. Understanding at-risk groups facilitates a targeted response considering indirect consequences of society’s reaction to a pandemic alongside disease-related impacts. COVID-19-related deaths mainly mirror historical patterns, and excess non-COVID-19-related deaths partly reflect reduced access to and uptake of healthcare during lockdown.

This paper offers a historical investigation of admissions and discharges for treatment episodes over the past two decades across race, ethnicity, gender, and age. Our results suggest that although older individuals are not typically associated with risky behavior, they are increasingly seeking treatment for substance use disorders. We find that substance use treatment admissions for people aged 50 and older have persistently increased over our sample period. Our findings also indicate that, on average, Black (relative to white) admissions across all ages are less likely to complete treatment and more likely to have their treatment terminated by a treatment facility. We also find some evidence that Hispanic admissions are relatively less likely to complete treatment across all age groups. Hispanics over 50 years old are also more likely to terminate treatment. Interestingly, among younger individuals in the most recent years of our sample, the disparity between minority completion rates has improved. Lastly, we find that males (relative to females) are more likely to complete a substance use treatment program but no more likely to have their treatment terminated by a substance use treatment facility.",2021-06-04,"Grooms, Jevay; Ortega, Alberto",Journal of substance abuse treatment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108443; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34102462/,235378448.0,2021.0,198

Concerns about the safety of administration of immunosuppressive drugs have been raised for treatment of psoriasis (PSO), and there is insufficient evidence for the risk of COVID-19 infection for psoriatic patients using these drugs, so we did a review, focusing on the risk of overall infection associated with the most commonly used immunosuppressive drugs such as methotrexate, biologics, cyclosporin, Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors for the treatment of PSO. The data on the effect of immunosuppressive drugs on this virus may be ever-changing and remains to be clear. We recommend the initiation and continuation of low-risk immunomodulating drugs such as Interleukin (IL)-17, IL-12/23, and IL-23 inhibitors for treatment of PSO during COVID-19 era. For psoriatic patients with comorbidities switching to safer modalities such as systemic retinoids, apremilast, and home phototherapy is recommended.

While the overall mortality is low, the virus is highly virulent and may infect millions of people worldwide. This will consequently burden health systems, particularly by those individuals considered to be at high risk of severe complications from COVID-19. Such risk factors include advanced age, cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, diabetes and cancer. However, few data on the outcomes of cancer patients infected by SARS CoV-2 exist. Therefore, there is a lack of guidance on how to manage cancer patients during the pandemic. We sought to propose specific recommendations about the management of patients with gastrointestinal malignancies. METHODS: The Brazilian Gastrointestinal Tumours Group board of directors and members sought up-to-date scientific literature on each tumour type and discussed all recommendations by virtual meetings to provide evidence-based—and sometimes, expert opinion—recommendation statements. Our objectives were to recommend evidence-based approaches to both treat and minimise the risk of COVID-19 for cancer patients, and simultaneously propose how to decrease the use of hospital resources at a time these resources need to be available to treat COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Overall and tumour-specific recommendations were made by stage (including surgical, locoregional, radiotherapy, systemic treatments and follow-up strategies) for the most common gastrointestinal malignancies: esophagus, gastric, pancreas, bile duct, hepatocellular, colorectal, anal cancer and neuroendocrine tumours. CONCLUSIONS: Our recommendations emphasise the importance of treating cancer patients, using the best evidence available, while simultaneously taking into consideration the world-wide health resource hyperutilisation to treat non-cancer COVID-19 patients.",2020-05-22,"Riechelmann, Rachel P; Peixoto, Renata D’Alpino; Fernandes, Gustavo Dos Santos; Weschenfelder, Rui F; Prolla, Gabriel; Filho, Duílio Rocha; Andrade, Aline Chaves; Crosara, Marcela; Rego, Juliana Florinda M; Gansl, Rene C; Coimbra, Felipe; Aguiar, Samuel; Carvalho, Elisângela; Hoff, Paulo M; Coutinho, Anelisa K",Ecancermedicalscience,https://doi.org/10.3332/ecancer.2020.1048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32565901/,219505589.0,2020.0,261
1zv3w2u8,WHO,Mathematical modeling and optimal intervention strategies of the COVID-19 outbreak,,unk,"34,354,966 active cases and 460,787 deaths because of COVID-19 pandemic were recorded on November 06, 2021, in India. To end this ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic, there is an urgent need to implement multiple population-wide policies like social distancing, testing more people and contact tracing. To predict the course of the pandemic and come up with a strategy to control it effectively, a compartmental model has been established. The following six stages of infection are taken into consideration: susceptible (S), asymptomatic infected (A), clinically ill or symptomatic infected (I), quarantine (Q), isolation (J) and recovered (R), collectively termed as SAIQJR. The qualitative behavior of the model and the stability of biologically realistic equilibrium points are investigated in terms of the basic reproduction number. We performed sensitivity analysis with respect to the basic reproduction number and obtained that the disease transmission rate has an impact in mitigating the spread of diseases. Moreover, considering the non-pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical intervention strategies as control functions, an optimal control problem is implemented to mitigate the disease fatality. To reduce the infected individuals and to minimize the cost of the controls, an objective functional has been constructed and solved with the aid of Pontryagin’s maximum principle. The implementation of optimal control strategy at the start of a pandemic tends to decrease the intensity of epidemic peaks, spreading the maximal impact of an epidemic over an extended time period. Extensive numerical simulations show that the implementation of intervention strategy has an impact in controlling the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 epidemic. Further, our numerical solutions exhibit that the combination of three controls are more influential when compared with the combination of two controls as well as single control. Therefore, the implementation of all the three control strategies may help to mitigate novel coronavirus disease transmission at this present epidemic scenario.

However, these materials mostly emit in the blue or green region, in which preparation of materials with long-wavelength (especially near-infrared) emission is still a great challenge. In this work, it is found that 2-(dimethyl amino) ethyl methacrylate (DMA) and itaconic anhydride (ITA) undergo a ring-opening reaction at room temperature, and subsequently generate zwitterionic compound (IDMA). Based on the clustering-triggered emission (CTE) mechanism, ionic bond can effectively promote the isolated electron-rich chromophores to form new emissive clusters with extended electron delocalization. Herein, two oligomers (P1 and P2) with different fluorescence emissions by controlling the concentration of zwitterionic monomers before polymerization are synthesized. It is worth noting that the maximum emission wavelength of P2 at high concentration is up to 712 nm, which is very rare in previous reports. In addition, the resulting oligomer (P2) shows typical aggregation-enhanced emission (AEE), excitation-dependent fluorescence, temperature-sensitive emission, and solvatochromism.

However, among the eight RCTs which investigated the effect of statins vs. placebos on the development of CVD, 56–79% of patients had the residual CVD risk after the trials. In three RCTs which investigated the effect of a high dose vs. a usual dose of statins on the development of CVD, 78–87% of patients in the high-dose statin arms still had the CVD residual risk after the trials. An analysis of the characteristics of patients in the RCTs suggests that elevated triglyceride (TG) and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), the existence of obesity/insulin resistance, and diabetes may be important metabolic factors which determine the statin residual CVD risk. To understand the association between lipid abnormalities and the development of atherosclerosis, we show the profile of lipoproteins and their normal metabolism, and the molecular and biological mechanisms for the development of atherosclerosis by high TG and/or low HDL-C in insulin resistance. The molecular biological mechanisms for the statin residual CVD risk include an increase of atherogenic lipoproteins such as small dense LDL and remnants, vascular injury and remodeling by inflammatory cytokines, and disturbed reverse cholesterol transport. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) agonists improve atherogenic lipoproteins, reverse the cholesterol transport system, and also have vascular protective effects, such as an anti-inflammatory effect and the reduction of the oxidative state. Ezetimibe, an inhibitor of intestinal cholesterol absorption, also improves TG and HDL-C, and reduces intestinal cholesterol absorption and serum plant sterols, which are increased by statins and are atherogenic, possibly contributing to reduce the statin residual CVD risk.",2022-03-22,"Yanai, Hidekatsu; Adachi, Hiroki; Hakoshima, Mariko; Katsuyama, Hisayuki",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8998547/,,2022.0,285

5wms8isb,WHO,The Limited Sensitivity of Chest Computed Tomography Relative to Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 Infection: A Systematic Review on COVID-19 Diagnostics,,unk,"OBJECTIVES: Several studies suggest the sensitivity of chest computed tomography (CT) is far greater than that of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in diagnosing COVID-19 patients, and therefore, CT should be included as a primary diagnostic tool. This systematic review aims to stratify studies as high or low risk of bias to determine the true sensitivity of CT for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection according to the unbiased (low risk) studies, a topic of particular importance given the insufficient quantity of RT-PCR kits in many countries. We focus on sensitivity as that is the chief advantage perceived of CT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This systematic review involved searching the PubMed and Google Scholar databases for articles conducted and published between January 1 and April 15, 2020. The quality assessment tool QUADAS-2 was used to stratify studies according to their risk of bias, and exclusion criteria included not providing the information deemed relevant for such a stratification, such as not indicating if the patients were symptomatic or asymptomatic, or identifying the source of the specimen for the reference standard, RT-PCR (eg, nasal, oropharyngeal, etc). Sensitivity values were then extracted, and random effects meta-analyses were performed. RESULTS: Of 641 search results, 37 studies (n = 9610 patients) were included in the analysis. The mean sensitivity of RT-PCR for COVID-19 reported by the biased studies was 70% (n = 5409/7 studies; 95% confidence interval [CI], 43-97; I = 99.1%), compared with 78% by unbiased studies (n = 534/4 studies; 95% CI, 69-87, I = 89.9%). For chest CT, the mean sensitivity reported by biased studies was 94% (n = 3371 patients/24 studies; 95% CI, 92-96; I = 93.1%), compared with 75% by unbiased studies (n = 957/10 studies; 95% CI, 67-83; I = 89.5%). CONCLUSIONS: The difference between the sensitivities of CT and RT-PCR for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection is lower than previously thought, as after stratifying the studies, the true sensitivity for CT based on the unbiased studies is limited.",,"Waller, Joseph V; Allen, Isabel E; Lin, Keldon K; Diaz, Michael J; Henry, Travis S; Hope, Michael D",Invest Radiol,,219900062.0,,331

We describe in detail, the methodology of a single pulse TMS protocol that was performed in a large cohort of people (n = 110) with multiple sclerosis (MS). The aim was to establish and validate a core-set of TMS variables that predicted typical MS clinical outcomes: walking speed, hand dexterity, fatigue, and cognitive processing speed. We provide a brief and simple methodological pipeline to examine excitatory and inhibitory corticospinal mechanisms in MS that map to clinical status. Delayed and longer ipsilateral silent period (a measure of transcallosal inhibition; the influence of one brain hemisphere's activity over the other), longer cortical silent period (suggestive of greater corticospinal inhibition via GABA) and higher resting motor threshold (lower corticospinal excitability) most strongly related to clinical outcomes, especially when measured in the hemisphere corresponding to the weaker hand. Greater interhemispheric asymmetry (imbalance between hemispheres) correlated with poorer performance in the greatest number of clinical outcomes. We also show, not surprisingly, that TMS variables related more strongly to motor outcomes than non-motor outcomes.

Methods Dancers from a ballet company completed a published, online dance-specific health questionnaire. Over the study period, dancers recorded wellbeing and training metrics, with menstrual cycle tracking and capillary blood testing for the recognised indicators of low energy availability. At regular, virtual clinical discussions with each dancer, findings were discussed and personalised advice given. Results Twenty dancers participated in the study (mean age 26.2 years, SD 3.7), comprising 14 females (mean age 25.5 years, SD 3.7) and 6 males (mean age 27.7 years, SD 2.4). Ten of the female and all the male dancers recorded positive scores on the dance health questionnaire, suggesting a low risk of relative energy deficiency in sport (RED-S). Two female dancers were taking hormonal contraception. Apart from one, all female dancers not on hormonal contraception reported current eumenorrhoeic status. Blood testing confirmed the low risk of insufficient energy availability across the group, apart from female dancers with negative questionnaire scores. The initiative of monitoring menstrual cycles and on demand virtual clinical support was well received by dancers, healthcare and artistic staff.

As an essential service, community pharmacists have been enacting a key role in patient counseling and supply of essential medicines and protective equipment. OBJECTIVES: To investigate pharmacists’ perspectives of the role of educational institutes and professional pharmacy organizations in supporting them to take on roles during COVID-19 pandemic and to identify barriers to be able to support themselves and their patients. METHODS: This descriptive mixed-method study was conducted via a cross-sectional online survey distributed to pharmacists/pharmacy students in Jordan during the COVID-19 outbreak (15–30 March 2020) using an online questionnaire, followed by an online focus group. Questionnaire items related to participants’ perspectives in being prepared for and supported in their roles during the COVID-19 pandemic, and items were tested for face validity. Data were descriptively analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences and triangulated with focus group findings. RESULTS: Considering that fear and anxiety are a consequence of mass social distancing/quarantine, study participants (n = 726, age = 26.9 (SD = 8.0) years, 71.9% females), reported needing training on mental healthcare to be able to support themselves and people during pandemics (90.2%). Most respondents agreed/strongly agreed (59.7%) with the statement around pharmacy educators/educational institutes having a key role in preparing pharmacists for practice during epidemics/pandemics and agreed that their faculties should add a course regarding pandemic preparedness in their curriculum (89.9%). Results were similar regarding roles for the pharmaceutical associations. Focus group findings (n = 7) mirrored the survey findings to a large extent.

Recently, the TME concept has been transformed into that of complete mesocolic excision (CME) in an attempt to improve prognosis for patients with colon cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS Multidisciplinary team (MDT) workshops including the CME concept were held annually between 2004 and 2008 at the Karolinska University Hospital. The workshops focused on preoperative staging, surgery and histopathology and included lectures and live surgery sessions. To compare survival before and after the ""Stockholm Colon Cancer Project"" all patients diagnosed with a right sided colon cancer between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2003 (Group 1) and from January 1, 2006 until December 31, 2008 (Group 2) in Stockholm were identified from the Swedish ColoRectal Cancer Registry (SCRCR). RESULTS The proportion of patients having a tumour resection and the proportion having emergency surgery was higher in Group 1. There were more early tumours and more R0 resections in Group 2. Overall survival in all diagnosed patients and disease free survival after tumour resection was improved in the second time period.

Based on drug repurposing strategy, we for the first time reported a novel series of troxipide analogs and then evaluated their antiproliferative activity against MCF-7, PC3, MGC-803, and PC9 cancer cell lines and WPMY-1, most of which showed obvious selectivity toward PC-3 over the other three cancer cell lines and WPMY-1. Compound 5q, especially, could effectively inhibit PC3 with an IC50 value of 0.91 µM, which exhibited around 53-fold selectivity toward WPMY-1. Data indicated that 5q effectively inhibited the colony formation, suppressed the cell migration, and induced G1/S phase arrest in PC3 cells. Also, compound 5q induced cell apoptosis by activating the two apoptotic signaling pathways in PC3 cells: death receptor-mediated extrinsic pathway and mitochondria-mediated intrinsic pathway. Compound 5q up-regulated the expression of both pro-apoptotic Bax and P53, while down-regulated anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 expression. Besides, compound 5q significantly increased the expression of cleaved caspase 3/9 and cleaved PARP.

However, the synthesis of highly porous carbon superstructures with macropores and carbon defects from a simple crystalline solid remains challenging. In this work, superstructured macroporous carbon rods composed of defective graphitic nanosheets are synthesized by direct carbonization of crystalline poly tannic acid (PTA) rods as precursors. During carbonization, PTA rods with a highly ordered lamellar structure induce a spatially confined two-step localized contraction that takes place in different dimensions and directions in each step. The unexpected contraction behavior results in the sponge-like macroporous carbon superstructure with large surface area, high porosity, and abundant defects, thus showing a superior electrocatalytic performance with high activity and selectivity for oxygen reduction reaction.

Dystonia is a poorly understood neurological movement disorder, often presenting in an idiopathic, isolated form across different parts of the body. The neurophysiological profile of isolated dystonia compared to healthy adults remains unclear. We conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis of neurophysiologic TMS measures in people with isolated dystonia to provide a synthesized understanding of cortical neurophysiology associated with isolated dystonia. We performed a systematic database search and data was extracted independently by the two authors. Separate meta-analyses were performed for TMS measures of: motor threshold, corticomotor excitability, short interval intracortical inhibition, cortical silent period, intracortical facilitation and afferent-induced inhibition. Standardised mean differences were calculated using a random effects model to determine overall effect sizes and confidence intervals. Heterogeneity was explored using dystonia type subgroup analysis. The search resulted in 78 studies meeting inclusion criteria, of these 57 studies reported data in participants with focal hand dystonia, cervical dystonia, blepharospasm or spasmodic dysphonia, and were included in at least one meta-analysis. The cortical silent period, short-interval intracortical inhibition and afferent-induced inhibition was found to be reduced in isolated dystonia compared to controls. Reduced GABAergic-mediated inhibition in the primary motor cortex in idiopathic isolated dystonia's suggest interventions targeted to aberrant cortical disinhibition could provide a novel treatment. Future meta-analyses require neurophysiology studies to use homogeneous cohorts of isolated dystonia participants, publish raw data values, and record electromyographic responses from dystonic musculature where possible.",,"McCambridge, Alana B; Bradnam, Lynley V",Eur. j. neurosci,,222160488.0,,250

It has previously been shown that the adoptive transfer of 5 × 107 nylon wool adherent (NWA) spleen cells from immunized donors to lethally infected recipients clears virus from the central nervous system (CNS) and prevents demyelination. Adoptive transfer of a smaller number (1 × 107) of NWA spleen cells from immunized donors also protects from death but does not significantly alter virus replication in the CNS during the acute phase of the infection. Moreover, these mice develop a transient non-fatal encephalomyelitis which occurs approximately 3 weeks post-infection. This delayed encephalomyelitis is associated with a mononuclear cell infiltration into the CNS but little or no evidence of virus replication or increased viral antigen. A virus-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response precedes this delayed onset of disease by 24 to 48 h. Resolution of disease correlates with a selective and permanent suppression of the JHMV-specific DTH reactivity. In addition, no virus-specific DTH is detected following adoptive transfer of viral-specific DTH effectors derived from immunized donors. In contrast, these mice respond to a heterologous antigen, KLH, suggesting that the resolution of the encephalitis is accompanied by a profound suppression in viral-specific DTH response.",1990-05-31,"Shubin, Richard A.; Sussman, Mark A.; Fleming, John O.; Stohlman, Stephen A.",Microbial Pathogenesis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1977071/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0882401090900899; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0882401090900899,38656877.0,1990.0,209

The deadline for implementing European legislation in this area means that strategic plans are being developed at local and regional level. In Spain there are municipal and regional strategies already developed and implemented but the national strategy has not yet been approved. To this end, the development of monitoring and evaluation tools such as the one presented in this article, can help not only in local decision-making, but also in the establishment of common criteria to help assess its future evolution. This research analyses the large peri-urban parks located in the southwest of the Community of Madrid (Spain). The evaluation is carried out from a local to a regional scale applying multifunctionality criteria to the planning, design, execution, maintenance and resilience phases. From the point of view of landscape structures, the findings of this study reflect a high environmental and social services delivery value, which makes it possible to understand the need to create networks to integrate the peri-urban spaces into the city and to attend to and understand the needs of all actors involved: citizens, political leaders, municipal technicians and private companies, providing them a common vision that improves the future of these spaces. This makes them core areas from which to design strategic plans for natural infrastructure and improvement of biodiversity in the urban area, being, likewise, an example that can be extrapolated and applied to large cities whose urban areas are adjoined and where peri-urban parks can be the starting point for designing supramunicipal strategies for open spaces. Based on these results we can conclude that south-west Madrid provides the ideal conditions for implementing a supra-municipal strategy for green infrastructures which, starting with its large forest parks, showcases the periurban areas which connect them with the urban green network. The Móstoles Green Network and Bosquesur are two strategic projects which, together with the forest parks, constitute a working framework based on which the Supra-municipal Strategy for Open Spaces in South-west Madrid can be devised.",,"Verdú-Vázquez, Amparo; Fernández-Pablos, Eva; Lozano-Diez, Rafael V; López-Zaldívar, Óscar",Urban Ecosyst,,220294922.0,,385

In 2020, New Zealand's border management and lockdown measures successfully eliminated community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and also largely eliminated influenza and many other respiratory viruses. This study investigates the contribution of infections and temperature to EWM and typical extended winter (May to October) deaths in this natural experiment created by New Zealand's COVID-19 pandemic response. Methods: We used age-standardised weekly deaths to measure EWM 2011 to 2019, then used historical patterns to estimate high, medium and low scenario 2020 EWMs. We then modelled typical year and 2020 heating degree day: mortality relationships to estimate relative contributions of cold temperature and infection to typical extended winter deaths. Results: EWM 2011 to 2019 averaged 14.7% (low 11.4%, high 20.9%). In contrast, 2020 EWM was estimated at 1.6%, 2.7%, or 3.8% under high, medium, and low spring-summer mortality scenarios. Between 2011 and 2019, temperature was estimated to explain 47% of extended winter deaths, and infection 27%, with the remaining 26% attributable to the interaction between infection and temperature. Discussion: The society-wide response to COVID-19 in 2020 resulted in a major reduction of winter mortality in this high-income nation with a temperate climate. In addition to influenza, other respiratory pathogens likely also make a significant contribution to EWM. Low cost protection measures such as mask wearing (eg, in residential care facilities), discouragement of sick presenteeism, and increased influenza vaccine coverage, all have potential to reduce future winter mortality.",2020-12-22,"Telfar-Barnard, L.; Baker, M.

Little is known about their role in situations where patients were or could have been harmed in a rural setting. Therefore, we sought to investigate rural general practice staff experiences of patient safety incidents and low quality of care. METHODS: Descriptive qualitative interviews using the critical incident technique. Systematic text condensation analysis involving GPs and practice staff in eight rural municipalities in Norway. RESULTS: Sixteen participants (eight GPs, one nurse and seven medical secretaries) with mean work experience of 11.8 years were interviewed for a total of 11.5 hours. We identified three main factors that make rural GP clinics vulnerable to patient safety incidents and low quality of care: use of locums, work overload and rough weather and distance to hospital. There was a wide range of patient safety incidents. The healthcare personnel explained how they used local knowledge about people and context and greater awareness of risk of error in order to prevent these incidents from happening. CONCLUSION: Rural GP clinics that suffer from frequent use of GP locums and work overload are vulnerable to patient safety incidents. Practice staff use various forms of continuity of care to prevent safety incidents from happening; this highlights the strengths but also some major safety concerns in these GP clinics.

Coronaviruses enter cells via fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane and/or via fusion of the viral envelope with endosomal membranes after virion endocytosis. The spike (S) glycoprotein is a major determinant of virus infectivity. Herein, we show that the transient expression of the SARS CoV‐2 S glycoprotein in Vero cells caused extensive cell fusion (formation of syncytia) in comparison to limited cell fusion caused by the SARS S glycoprotein. Both S glycoproteins were detected intracellularly and on transfected Vero cell surfaces. These results are in agreement with published pathology observations of extensive syncytia formation in lung tissues of patients with COVID‐19. These results suggest that SARS CoV‐2 is able to spread from cell‐to‐cell much more efficiently than SARS effectively avoiding extracellular neutralizing antibodies. A systematic screening of several drugs including cardiac glycosides and kinase inhibitors and inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) entry revealed that only the FDA‐approved HIV protease inhibitor, nelfinavir mesylate (Viracept) drastically inhibited S‐n‐ and S‐o‐mediated cell fusion with complete inhibition at a 10‐μM concentration. In‐silico docking experiments suggested the possibility that nelfinavir may bind inside the S trimer structure, proximal to the S2 amino terminus directly inhibiting S‐n‐ and S‐o‐mediated membrane fusion. Also, it is possible that nelfinavir may act to inhibit S proteolytic processing within cells. These results warrant further investigations of the potential of nelfinavir mesylate to inhibit virus spread at early times after SARS CoV‐2 symptoms appear.",2020-05-17,"Musarrat, Farhana; Chouljenko, Vladimir; Dahal, Achyut; Nabi, Rafiq; Chouljenko, Tamara; Jois, Seetharama D.; Kousoulas, Konstantin G.",J Med Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32374457/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25985,218518856.0,2020.0,254
fmmkn93b,WHO,Psychiatric Aspects of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine Treatment in the Wake of Coronavirus Disease-2019: Psychopharmacological Interactions and Neuropsychiatric Sequelae,,unk,"BACKGROUND: Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are among several experimental treatments being investigated in the urgent response to the coronavirus disease-2019. With increased use of these medications, physicians need to become knowledgeable of these drugs' neuropsychiatric side effects and interactions with psychiatric medications. OBJECTIVE: Clarify evidence base regarding the psychiatric side effects and psychiatric drug interactions of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. METHODS: A literature review was performed in PubMed from 1950 to 2020 regarding psychiatric topics and targeted pharmacological properties of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. RESULTS: First, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may mildly inhibit CYP2D6 metabolism of psychiatric medications, and psychiatric medications that interfere with CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 activity could alter chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine levels. Second, they may prolong the QT interval, warranting caution with concomitant prescription of other QT prolonging agents. Finally, neuropsychiatric side effects are very uncommon but possible and include a potentially prolonged phenomenon of ""psychosis after chloroquine."" Hydroxychloroquine has less information available about its neuropsychiatric side effects than chloroquine, with psychosis literature limited to several case reports. Weak evidence suggests a possible association of hydroxychloroquine exposure and increased suicidal ideation. It is not clear whether patients with psychiatric illness are more vulnerable to neuropsychiatric sequela of these medications; however, overdose of these medications by suicidal patients has high risk of mortality. CONCLUSION: The risk of neuropsychiatric side effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine when used for coronavirus disease-2019 treatment is not known. Best practice may include suicide risk assessment for patients treated with hydroxychloroquine. However, delirium is expected to be a more likely etiology of neuropsychiatric symptoms in critically ill patients treated for coronavirus disease-2019, and adjustment disorder is a much more likely etiology of anxiety and depression symptoms than the side effects of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine.",,"Hamm, Brandon S; Rosenthal, Lisa J",Psychosomatics,,220383552.0,,285

OBJECTIVES: To assess HBoV prevalence and associated disease in a cohort of respiratory patients in the East Midlands, UK between 2015 and 2019. STUDY DESIGN: We initially investigated the undiagnosed burden of HBoV in a retrospective paediatric cohort sampled between 2015 and 2017 using an in-house PCR assay. HBoV was subsequently incorporated into the standard respiratory diagnostic pathway and we audited a calendar year of HBoV positive results between 2018 and 2019. RESULTS: Our retrospective PCR screening of previously routine diagnostic-negative samples from juvenile patients identified a 9% (n = 30) prevalence of HBoV type 1. These apparentHBoV1 mono-infections were frequently associated with respiratory tract symptoms, often severe including ventilation, oxygen and steroid intervention with 31% (n = 9) of individuals requiring intensive care. When HBoV screening was subsequently adopted into the routine respiratory diagnostic pathway, year-round infections were observed in both children and adults peaking in February. 185 of 9098 (2.03%) individuals were found to be HBoV positive with children aged 12-24 months the principally infected group. However, HBoV infection was also observed in patients aged over 60, predominantly as a mono-infection. 23% of the 185 unique patients were HBoV monoinfectedand persistent low-level DNA positivity was observed in 15 individuals up to 6-months after initial presentation. CONCLUSION: HBoV1 is a prevalent respiratory infection in the UK capable of causing serious monoinfections.",2020-05-21,"Bagasi, Arwa A.; Howson-Wells, Hannah C.; Clark, Gemma; Tarr, Alexander W.; Soo, Shiu; Irving, William L.; McClure, C.

23go9scr,Medline,Evaluation of a Domestic Steam Disinfector-Dryer Device for Disinfection of Health Care Workers' Identification Lanyards.,10.1177/21650799211012653,unk,"BACKGROUND Fabric lanyards are commonly worn by health care workers (HCWs) and are known to harbor infectious organisms and contribute to the transmission of infection to HCWs and patients. A diverse range of nosocomial pathogens have been found on lanyards, but there are very few studies describing how to successfully disinfect lanyards to break the chain of transmission. Recently, a steam disinfector-dryer device has come on the market, which performs rapid disinfection against nosocomial pathogens and also dries the contents of the device. It was the aim of this study to evaluate steam disinfection-drying as a method to eliminate pathogens from lanyards. METHODS Thirty-eight strips of new, unused, and autoclaved polyester neck lanyards (4 × 2 cm) were inoculated with 30 (12 Gram-positive + 18 Gram-negative) bacteria and one yeast organism. The inoculated lanyard fabric (five organisms per lanyard strip) was placed into a steam disinfector-dryer device and disinfected for 5 minutes and dried for 30 minutes, in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Following disinfection and drying, the presence of viable organisms on lanyard fabric was evaluated using enhanced microbiological broth culture methods for 48 hours. Control lanyard strips were treated with organisms and left at room temperature without undergoing disinfection and drying procedures. FINDINGS Steam disinfection-drying eradicated all test organisms from treated lanyards, with no culturable organisms detected following disinfection-drying, even when employing enhanced bacteriological culture conditions. All test organisms remained viable on the control lanyards. CONCLUSION/APPLICATION TO PRACTICE Steam disinfection-drying offers a simple method of decontaminating lanyards, producing dry lanyards for immediate reuse. Occupational health practitioners and hospitals should consider assessing the feasibility of adopting this method in their settings to aid in breaking the chain of transmission of nosocomial pathogens via contaminated lanyards.",2021-06-09,"Millar, Beverley C; Moore, John E",Workplace health & safety,https://doi.org/10.1177/21650799211012653; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34105427/,235378333.0,2021.0,286

Our study aims to assess the early impact of COVID-19 lockdown on violent and accidental deaths in Peru. Methods: Based on data from the Peruvian National Death Information System, an interrupted time series analysis was performed to assess the immediate impact and change in the trend of COVID-19 lockdown on external causes of death including homicide, suicide, and traffic accidents. The analysis was stratified by sex and the time unit was every 15 days. Results: All forms of deaths examined presented a sudden drop after the lockdown. The biggest drop was in deaths related to traffic accidents, with a reduction of 12.66 deaths per million men per month (95% CI: -15.56, -9.76) and 3.64 deaths per million women per month (95% CI:-5.25, -2.03). Homicide and suicide presented similar level drop in women, while the homicide reduction was twice the size of the suicide reduction in men. The slope in suicide in men during the lock-down period increased by 3.62 deaths per million men per year (95% CI:0.06, 7.18). No other change in slope was detected. Conclusions: Violent and accidental deaths presented a sudden drop after the lockdown was implemented and an increase in suicide in men was observed.

Using this method dermatologists can diagnose a condition with the help of pictures of the lesions and short history. During the COVID-19 pandemic, practicing this method has become more relevant. Providing teleconsultations to patients with fungal skin infections can prevent inadvertent use of topical corticosteroids. The objective of this study was to find the prevalence of fungal infections among teledermatology consultations done in a tertiary care hospital. METHODS: It was a descriptive cross-sectional study where the store and forward and real-time methods were used between February 2020 to July 2020. Ethical clearance was taken from the institutional review board (reference number: 245). Data of those patients who wanted consultations from this department were sent by medical officers deployed in military hospitals that are under the central army hospital located in Kathmandu. Convenient sampling was used. The collected data was entered and analyzed in the Statistical Package of Social Sciences version 20. Point estimate at 95% Confidence Interval was calculated along with frequency and percentage for binary data. RESULTS: A total of 451 (33.45%) (30.93-35.97 at 95% Confidence Interval) were diagnosed with fungal infections out of 1348 patients who were enrolled for the study.

However, little is known about the risk of infection during hospitalization or its consequences. The aim of this work was to report a series of patients hospitalized on digestive surgery services who developed a nosocomial infection with SARS-Cov-2 virus. Methods This is a non-interventional retrospective study carried out within three departments of digestive surgery. The clinical, biological and radiological data of the patients who developed a nosocomial infection with SARS-Cov-2 were collected from the computerized medical record. Results From March 1, 2020 to April 5, 2020, among 305 patients admitted to digestive surgery services, 15 (4.9%) developed evident nosocomial infection with SARS-Cov-2. There were nine men and six women, with a median age of 62 years (35–68 years). All patients had co-morbidities. The reasons for hospitalization were: surgical treatment of cancer (n =5), complex emergencies (n =5), treatment of complications linked to cancer or its treatment (n =3), gastroplasty (n =1), and stoma closure (n =1). The median time from admission to diagnosis of SARS-Cov-2 infection was 34 days (5–61 days). In 12 patients (80%), the diagnosis was made after a hospital stay of more than 14 days (15–63 days). At the end of the follow-up, two patients had died, seven were hospitalized with two of them on respiratory assistance, and six patients were discharged post-hospitalization.

This retrospective study was undertaken to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on cases of maxillofacial trauma and its etiologic variation by comparing it with the previous year archived data. Materials and Methods: Patients with maxillofacial fracture visiting during the lockdown period (Phase) were compared to the patient's record during the same time period in the year 2019 (Control). They were subcategorised based on the etiology of trauma, i.e., road traffic accident (RTA), self-fall, physical assault and animal attacks. Age and gender variations were also assessed. Degree of significance was calculated using t test and p value obtained. Result: Mean age of trauma patients during lockdown and control period was 32.66 and 27.93 years, respectively. Number of cases of overall trauma had significantly decreased. Cases of RTA and self-fall were 22 and 4 in lockdown compared to 135 and 16 during control phase. Cases of physical assault increased by 50%, i.e., from 9 to 6 on comparison of both the phases. Animal attack maxillofacial injuries were 2 in each group. Conclusion: RTA and subsequent drop in numbers of maxillofacial trauma can be shown as the benefit of lockdown nonetheless on the other side increase in number of physical assaults also shows how isolation and restrictions have psychological negative impact on society.",,"Prakash, Om; Prajapati, V K; Shahi, Ajoy Kumar; Khaitan, Tanya",J Maxillofac Oral Surg,,227076936.0,,226

In Study 1 (180 university students, 66% female) participants read summaries describing evidence for sexual orientation existing on a continuum versus discrete categories or a control manipulation, and in Study 2 (460 participants in a nationally representative Qualtrics panel, 50% female) additionally read summaries describing sexual orientation as fluid versus stable across the life-course. After reading summaries, participants answered various questions about their sexual orientation. In Study 1, political moderates and progressives (but not conservatives) who read the continuous manipulation subsequently reported being less exclusively heterosexual, and regardless of political alignment, participants reported less certainty about their sexual orientation, relative to controls. In Study 2, after exposure to fluid or continuous manipulations heterosexual participants were up to five times more likely than controls to rate themselves as non-exclusively heterosexual. Additionally, those in the continuous condition reported less certainty about their sexual orientation and were more willing to engage in future same-sex sexual experiences, than those in the control condition.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study included 355 adolescents with chronic conditions and 111 healthy adolescents. An online self-rated survey was used to investigate socio-demographic features, healthcare routine, and the quarantine impact on physical and mental health. The validated self-reported version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was also applied. RESULTS: The median of age [14 (10-18) vs. 15 (10-18) years, p = 0.733] and frequencies of female (61% vs. 60%, p = 0.970) were similar between adolescents with preexisting chronic conditions and healthy adolescents during quarantine of COVID-19 pandemic. The frequencies of abnormal total difficulties score of SDQ were similar in patients and controls (30% vs. 31%, p = 0.775). Logistic regression analysis showed that being female (OR = 1.965; 95% CI = 1.091-3.541, p = 0.024), fear of underlying disease activity/complication (OR = 1.009; 95%CI = 1.001-1.018, p = 0.030) were associated with severe psychosocial dysfunction in adolescents with chronic conditions, whereas school homework (OR = 0.449; 95% CI = 0.206-0.981, p = 0.045) and physical activity (OR = 0.990; 95% CI = 0.981-0.999, p = 0.030) were protective factors.

RBM and RBQM focus on the detection of events or trends that impact trial quality in terms of participant safety and data integrity. In 2019, the Association of Clinical Research Organizations (ACRO) began a landscape survey of RBM/RBQM implementation in ongoing clinical trials. Initial results of this survey, representing full-year data for 2019, were reported previously. Here, we present full-year landscape data for 2020 drawn from 5,987 clinical trials ongoing at the end of 2020, including 908 new studies started that year. Of these trials, 77% implemented at least one RBM/RBQM component, an increase from 47% for studies ongoing at the end of 2019. We also observed increased implementation for three of the five RBM components included in the survey. Centralized monitoring decreased nominally in 2020 compared with 2019. Although the percentages of 2020 trials incorporating reduced source data verification (SDV) and reduced source data review (SDR) increased from 2019 to 2020, these numbers are still low considering the large percentage of trials implementing at least one RBQM component. In the current clinical trial landscape, as more DCTs are launched and new data collection technologies are implemented, there remains a pressing need for greater use of centralized monitoring coupled with reductions in SDR/SDV and, ultimately, greater adoption of RBM and RBQM.",2022-03-02,"Stansbury, Nicole; Barnes, Brian; Adams, Amy; Berlien, Ruth; Branco, Danilo; Brown, Debby; Butler, Paula; Garson, Lauren; Jendrasek, Debra; Manasco, Garrett; Ramirez, Nycole; Sanjuan, Nelly; Worman, Gillian; Adelfio, Anina",Ther Innov Regul Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35235192/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s43441-022-00387-z,247188798.0,2022.0,259

SARS-CoV-2 uses as a receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), a critical member of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) involved in the regulation of blood pressure and fluid system. In addition to the systemic endocrine functions, RAAS components are also involved in intracrine and organ-specific local functions. The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) is a key component of RAAS and a receptor for SARS-CoV-2. It is expressed in many tissues with gastrointestinal (GI) tract ACE-2 levels far exceeding those in the respiratory tract. SARS-CoV-2 binding to its receptor results in a deficiency of ACE-2 activity in endocrine, intracrine, and local lung and GI tract ACE-2. The local ACE-2 has different organ-specific functions, including hypertension-independent activities; dysregulations of these functions may contribute to multiorgan COVID-19 pathology, its severity, long-term effects, and mortality. We review supporting evidence from this standpoint. Notably, COVID-19 comorbidities involving hypertension, obesity, heart disease, kidney disease, and diabetes are associated with gastrointestinal problems and display ACE-2 deficits. While RAAS inhibitors target both endocrine and intracrine ACE-2 activity, the deficit of the local ACE-2 activity in the lungs and more so in the gut have not been targeted. Consequently, the therapeutic approach to COVID-19 should be carefully reconsidered. Ongoing clinical trials testing oral probiotic bound ACE-2 delivery are promising.",2021-06-11,"Sajdel-Sulkowska, Elizabeth M.",Front Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.684610; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34177593/,235397011.0,2021.0,231
my81275x,ArXiv,On the robustness of effectiveness estimation of nonpharmaceutical interventions against COVID-19 transmission,,arxiv,"There remains much uncertainty about the relative effectiveness of different nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) against COVID-19 transmission. Several studies attempt to infer NPI effectiveness with cross-country, data-driven modelling, by linking from NPI implementation dates to the observed timeline of cases and deaths in a country. These models make many assumptions. Previous work sometimes tests the sensitivity to variations in explicit epidemiological model parameters, but rarely analyses the sensitivity to the assumptions that are made by the choice the of model structure (structural sensitivity analysis). Such analysis would ensure that the inferences made are consistent under plausible alternative assumptions. Without it, NPI effectiveness estimates cannot be used to guide policy. We investigate four model structures similar to a recent state-of-the-art Bayesian hierarchical model. We find that the models differ considerably in the robustness of their NPI effectiveness estimates to changes in epidemiological parameters and the data. Considering only the models that have good robustness, we find that results and policy-relevant conclusions are remarkably consistent across the structurally different models. We further investigate the common assumptions that the effect of an NPI is independent of the country, the time, and other active NPIs. We mathematically show how to interpret effectiveness estimates when these assumptions are violated.",2020-07-27,"Sharma, Mrinank; Mindermann, Soren; Brauner, Jan Markus; Leech, Gavin; Stephenson, Anna B.; Gavenvciak, Tom'avs; Kulveit, Jan; Teh, Yee Whye; Chindelevitch, Leonid; Gal, Yarin",Unknown,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.13454v1.pdf,220793438.0,2020.0,203

This study aimed to estimate direct and indirect costs for first-ever acute ischemic stroke (AIS) during the first year for patients residing in Cluj, Romania, and hospitalized in 2019 at the County Emergency Hospital (CEH). Methods: The study was conducted using a mixed, retrospective costing methodology from a societal perspective to measure the cost of first-ever AIS in the first year after onset. Patient pathways for AIS were reconstructed to aid in mapping inpatient and outpatient cost items. We used anonymized administrative and clinical data at the hospital level and publicly available databases. Results: The average cost per patient in the first year after stroke onset was RON 25,297.83 (EUR 5226.82), out of which 80.87% were direct costs. The total cost in Cluj, Romania in 2019 was RON 17,455,502.7 (EUR 3,606,505.8). Conclusions: Our costing exercise uncovered shortcomings of stroke management in Romania, particularly related to acute care and neurorehabilitation service provision.

Therefore, a significant study is necessary for detecting COVID-19 cases using an automated diagnosis method, which can aid in controlling the spreading of the virus. In this paper, the study suggests a Deep Convolutional Neural Network-based multi-classification approach (COV-MCNet) using eight different pre-trained architectures such as VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50V2, DenseNet201, InceptionV3, MobileNet, InceptionResNetV2, Xception which are trained and tested on the X-ray images of COVID-19, Normal, Viral Pneumonia, and Bacterial Pneumonia. The results from 3-class (Normal vs. COVID-19 vs. Viral Pneumonia) showed that only the ResNet50V2 model provides the highest classification performance (accuracy: 95.83%, precision: 96.12%, recall: 96.11%, F1-score: 96.11%, specificity: 97.84%) compared to rest of the models. The results from 4-class (Normal vs. COVID-19 vs. Viral Pneumonia vs. Bacterial Pneumonia) demonstrated that the pre-trained model DenseNet201 provides the highest classification performance (accuracy: 92.54%, precision: 93.05%, recall: 92.81%, F1-score: 92.83%, specificity: 97.47%). Notably, the ResNet50V2 (3-class) and DenseNet201 (4-class) models in the proposed COV-MCNet framework showed higher accuracy compared to the rest six models. This indicates that the designed system can produce promising results to detect the COVID-19 cases on the availability of more data.

4lcqi84g,WHO,The Benefits of Vitamin D Supplementation for Athletes: Better Performance and Reduced Risk of COVID-19,,unk,"The COVID-19 pandemic is having major economic and personal consequences for collegiate and professional sports. Sporting events have been canceled or postponed, and even when baseball and basketball seasons resumed in the United States recently, no fans were in attendance. As play resumed, several players developed COVID-19, disrupting some of the schedules. A hypothesis now under scientific consideration is that taking vitamin supplements to raise serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations could quickly reduce the risk and/or severity of COVID-19. Several mechanisms have been identified through which vitamin D could reduce the risks of infection and severity, death, and long-haul effects of COVID-19: (1) inducing production of cathelicidin and defensins to reduce the survival and replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus; (2) reducing inflammation and the production of proinflammatory cytokines and risk of the ""cytokine storm"" that damages the epithelial layer of the lungs, heart, vascular system, and other organs; and (3) increasing production of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, thus limiting the amount of angiotensin II available to the virus to cause damage. Clinical trials have confirmed that vitamin D supplementation reduces risk of acute respiratory tract infections, and approximately 30 observational studies have shown that incidence, severity, and death from COVID-19 are inversely correlated with serum 25(OH)D concentrations. Vitamin D supplementation is already familiar to many athletes and sports teams because it improves athletic performance and increases playing longevity. Thus, athletes should consider vitamin D supplementation to serve as an additional means by which to reduce risk of COVID-19 and its consequences.",,"Grant, William B; Lahore, Henry; Rockwell, Michelle S",Nutrients,,228079775.0,,250

We evaluated characteristics associated with obtaining a COVID-19 test from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and receiving a positive test result for COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of 6 292 800 veterans in VHA care at 130 VHA medical facilities. We assessed the number of tests for SARS-CoV-2 administered by the VHA (n = 822 934) and the number of positive test results (n = 82 094) from February 8 through December 28, 2020. We evaluated associations of COVID-19 testing and test positivity with demographic characteristics of veterans, adjusting for facility characteristics, comorbidities, and county-level area-based socioeconomic measures using nested generalized linear models. RESULTS: In fully adjusted models, veterans who were female, Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, urban, and low income and had a disability had an increased likelihood of obtaining a COVID-19 test, and veterans who were Asian had a decreased likelihood of obtaining a COVID-19 test. Compared with veterans who were White, veterans who were Black/African American (risk ratio [RR] = 1.23; 95% CI, 1.19-1.27) and Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander (RR = 1.13; 95% CI, 1.05-1.21) had an increased likelihood of receiving a positive test result. Hispanic/Latino veterans had a 43% higher likelihood of receiving a positive test result than non-Hispanic/Latino veterans did. CONCLUSIONS: Although veterans have access to subsidized health care at the VHA, the increased risk of receiving a positive test result for COVID-19 among Black and Hispanic/Latino veterans, despite receiving more tests than White and non-Hispanic/Latino veterans, suggests that other factors (eg, social inequities) are driving disparities in COVID-19 prevalence.",,"Ferguson, Jacqueline M; Abdel Magid, Hoda S; Purnell, Amanda L; Kiang, Mathew V; Osborne, Thomas F",Public Health Rep,,233185538.0,,267

Case Description A 75-year-old Japanese man was brought into our emergency department after receiving a left retroauricular stab wound by broken glass fragments. After spinal immobilization, a computed tomographic (CT) scan revealed glass fragments penetrating at the right craniocervical junction to the inter-atlanto-occipital subarachnoid space. CT angiography showed that both vertebral arteries (VAs) were not injured. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated that the glass fragments did not penetrate the cervical cord or medulla oblongata (MO). These glass fragments were removed via a midline incision from the external occipital protuberance to the C7 and with laminectomy without suboccipital craniectomy. Five of the glass fragments were found and removed in total. The dural defect was patched with a free fascia autograft. His postoperative course was uneventful. Postoperative CT angiography showed that both the vertebral arteries were intact as well as the complete removal of the glass fragments. Conclusions CT graphical diagnosis is useful for the management of penetrating craniocervical junction trauma, and it should be considered in the evaluation of patients who have suffered craniocervical penetrating injury even in the absence of major wounds or bleeding. Spinal immobilization of patients with craniocervical penetrating injuries is crucial to avoid not only secondary neurological damage but also secondary critical vascular damage.

In Brazil, municipalities were empowered to define regulatory measures, potentially resulting in diverse effects on CVD morbimortality. Objective: To analyse the impact of COVID-19 pandemics on CVD outcomes in Belo Horizonte (BH), the 6th greater capital city in Brazil, including: mortality, mortality at home, hospitalizations, intensive care unit utilization, and in-hospital mortality; and the differential effect according to sex, age range, social vulnerability, and pandemics phase. Methods: Ecological study analysing data from the Mortality and Hospital Information System of BH residents aged [≥]30 years. CVD was defined as in Chapter IX from ICD-10. Social vulnerability was classified by a composite socioeconomic index as high, medium and low. The observed age-standardized rates for epidemiological weeks 10-48, 2020, were compared to the expected rates (mean of 2015-2019). Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to test differences, and risk ratios with their 95% confidence intervals were calculated. National demographic estimates was used to calculate rates. Results: We found no changes in CVD mortality rates (RiR 1.01, 95%CI 0.96-1.06). However, CVD deaths occurred more at homes (RiR 1.32, 95%CI 1.20-1.46) than in hospitals (RiR 0.89, 95%CI 0.79-0.99), as a result of a substantial decline in hospitalization rates, even though proportional in-hospital deaths increased. The rise in home deaths was greater in older adults and in had an increasing gradient in those more socially vulnerable (RiR 1.45); for high (RiR 1.45), medium (RiR 1.32) and low vulnerability (RiR 1.21). Conclusion: The greater occurrence of CVD deaths at home, in parallel with lower hospitalization rates, suggests that CVD care was disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemics, which more adversely affected older and more socially vulnerable individuals, exacerbating health inequities in BH.",2021-10-11,"Brant, L.

Different countries face the effect of the virus differently. In India, very little research has been done to find the virus transmission. The paper's main objective is to find changing pattern of the footprint of the hotspot. The confirmed, recovered, and deceased cases of the Covid-19 from April 2020 to Jan 2021 is chosen for the analysis. The study found a sudden change in the hotspot district and a similar change in the footprint from August. Change pattern of the hotspot's footprint will show that October is the most dangerous month for the first wave of the Corona. This type of study is helpful for the health department to understand the behavior of the virus during the pandemic. To find the presence of the clustering pattern in the dataset, we use Global Moran’s I. A value of Global Moran’s I greater than zero shows the clustering in the data set. Dataset is temporal, and for each type of case, the value Global Moran’s I > 0, shows the presence of clustering. Local Moran’s I find the location of cluster i.e., the hotspot. The dataset is granulated at the district level. A district with a high Local Moran’s I surrounded by a high Local Moran’s I value is considered the hotspot. Monte Carlo simulation with 999 simulations is taken to find the statistical significance. So, for the 99% significance level, the p-value is taken as 0.001. A hotspot that satisfies the p-value threshold is considered the statistically significant hotspot. The footprint of the hotspot is found from the coverage of the hotspot. Finally, a change vector is defined that finds the pattern of change in the time series of the hotspot’s footprint.

We used a physical model for simulation to explore fire safety through a series of ignition trials. An HFNO device was attached to a 3D-printed nose with nostrils connected to a degutted raw chicken. The HFNO device was set at twenty combinations of different oxygen concentration and gas flow rate. An electrocautery and diode laser were applied separately to a fat cube in the cavity of the chicken. Ten 30 s trials of continuous energy source application were conducted. An additional trial of continuous energy application was conducted if no ignition was observed for all the ten trials. A total of eight short flashes were observed in one hundred electrocautery tests; however, no continuous fire was observed among them. There were thirty-six events of ignition in one hundred trials with laser, twelve of which turned into violent self-sustained fires. The factors found to be related to a significantly increased chance of ignition included laser application, lower gas flow, and higher FiO2. The native tissue and smoke can ignite and turn into violent self-sustained fires under HFNO and continuous laser strikes, even in the absence of combustible materials.

In March 2020, the UK implemented the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme - known as furlough - to minimize the impact of job losses. We investigate associations between change in employment status and mental and social wellbeing during the early stages of the pandemic. MethodsData from 25,670 respondents, aged 16 to 66, from nine UK longitudinal studies were analysed. Changes in employment (including being furloughed) were defined by comparing employment status pre-pandemic and during the first lockdown. Mental and social wellbeing outcomes included psychological distress, life satisfaction, self-rated health, social contact, and loneliness. Study-specific modified Poisson regression estimates, adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics and pre-pandemic outcome measures, were pooled using meta-analysis. ResultsCompared to those who remained working, furloughed workers were at greater risk of psychological distress (adjusted risk ratio, ARR=1.12; 95% CI: 0.97, 1.29), low life satisfaction (ARR=1.14; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.22), loneliness (ARR=1.12; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.23), and fair/poor self-rated health (ARR=1.26; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.50), but risk ratios appear less pronounced compared to those no longer employed (e.g., psychological distress, ARR=1.39; 95% CI: 1.21, 1.59) or stable unemployed (e.g., psychological distress, ARR=1.33; 95% CI: 1.09, 1.62).

METHODS: The CPVT involves placement of a vibrating cellphone on the center of the forehead to determine which ear perceives the sound louder. 40 consecutive adult patients with an audiogram within 6 months and no report of recent hearing changes were recruited. Group 1 consisted of 20 patients who were examined by the provider with the CPVT and WTFT using various tuning forks (256, 512, and 1024 Hz). Group 2 consisted of an additional 20 patients who received instructions on self‐administering the CPVT. Kappa statistics were calculated to assess the strength of concordance between the CPVT, WTFT, and audiometric findings for group 1 and between patient self‐administered and provider administered CPVT and WTFT for group 2. RESULTS: Concordance between CPVT and WTFT in the entire cohort was substantial (Kappa coefficient: 0.81 for 256 Hz, 0.73 for 512 Hz, and 0.62 for 1024 Hz) with similar concordances between actual and expected results based on audiogram (Kappa coefficient: 0.52 for CPVT and 0.52 for WTFT). Concordance between patient‐administered and provider‐administered CPVT showed almost perfect agreement (Kappa coefficient: 0.92). CONCLUSIONS: The CPVT provides consistent results when compared to a formal WTFT and can be reliably self‐administered by patients with appropriate instructions.

However, less is known about how the experiences of racism impact the stress levels of emergency health care workers (EHCWs). OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to assess the impact that racism has on the stress of EHCWs. METHODS: An anonymous electronic cross-sectional survey of EHCWs including attending physicians, resident physicians, advanced practice providers, nurses, and staff at three large metropolitan hospitals was administered in the summer of 2020. The survey evaluated the stress related to systemic racism and the COVID-19 pandemic in addition to the wellness measures utilized to cope with these stressors. The focus of this article is the impact of systemic racism on EHCWs. RESULTS: Of the 576 eligible participants, the total number of respondents utilized for analysis was 260. Overall, 64% of participants were very concerned about the state of racism in the United States, and 30% reported moderate-high or high stress resulting from racism. When stratified by race, 46% of Black participants reported moderate-high or high stress resulting from racism, compared to 31% of other participants of color and 23% of White participants (p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Systemic racism is a significant concern and source of stress for EHCWs.

Therefore, we conducted a web-based, cross-sectional study to investigate these changes among Japanese workers suffering from pain. A total of 1941 workers who were aged 20–64 years and suffered from body pain within 4 weeks prior to the study were included. Information was collected using a self-reported questionnaire between July and August 2020. Among the respondents, 15% reported that their pain worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Approximately half of the workers claimed to have decreased physical activity (47%) and increased psychological stress (47%) during the pandemic. Multivariable logistic regression analyses found that telework (odds ratio 2.27, 95% confidence interval 1.68–3.06), decreased physical activity (3.18, 2.38–4.27), and increased psychological stress (2.16, 1.64–2.84) were associated significantly with pain augmentation.

This study evaluated possible changes in child eating behaviors, parental feeding practices, and parental motivations when buying food during the lockdown, compared to the period before the lockdown. Parents of 498 children aged 3-12 years (238 boys; M = 7.32; SD = 2.27) completed an online survey with items from validated questionnaires (e.g., CEDQ, CEBQ, HomeSTEAD). They reported on their (child's) current situation during the lockdown, and retrospectively on the period before the lockdown. Many parents reported changes in child eating behaviors, feeding practices, and food shopping motivations. When changes occurred, child appetite, food enjoyment, food responsiveness and emotional overeating significantly increased during the lockdown. Increased child boredom significantly predicted increased food responsiveness, emotional overeating and snack frequency in between meals. When parents changed their practices, they generally became more permissive: less rules, more soothing with food, more child autonomy. They bought pleasurable and sustainable foods more frequently, prepared more home-cooked meals and cooked more with the child. Level of education and increased stress level predicted changes in parental practices and motivations. This study provides insights in factors that can induce positive and negative changes in families' eating, feeding and cooking behaviors.

Liver injury is not uncommon in patients with COVID-19, and clarifying its characteristics is needed. This study aimed to identify factors associated with liver injury and to develop a new classification of predictive severity in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Confirmed patients with COVID-19 (n = 60) were recruited retrospectively from Musashino Red Cross Hospital. The factors of liver injury especially on the elevation of liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) were analyzed. Grading was assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. RESULTS: During a median hospitalization follow-up of 15 (4-41) days, 51 (85.0%) patients had COVID-19 pneumonia. In clinical courses, oxygenation was needed for 25 (41.6%) patients and intubation was needed for 9 (15.0%) patients. A total of 27 (45.0%) patients had gastrointestinal symptoms (GS), such as appetite loss, diarrhea, and nausea. A logistic regression analysis revealed that C-reactive protein (CRP) at baseline, oxygenation, intubation, and GS were significant factors of liver injury. Based on these results, patients were classified into three groups: group 1, no oxygenation pneumonia; group 2, pneumonia with oxygenation or GS; and group 3, intubation. We classified 25 (41.7%), 26 (43.3%), and 9 (15.0%) patients into mild, moderate, and severe groups, respectively. The peak of AST and ALT levels was significantly stratified with this criteria (mild [median AST, 28 IU/L; median ALT, 33 IU/L], moderate [median AST, 48 IU/L; median ALT, 47.5 IU/L], and severe [median AST, 109 IU/L; median ALT, 106 IU/L]; P<0.001 and P = 0.0114, respectively).

w944e6lc,WHO,COVID-19 and severe ENT infections in pediatric patients. IS there a relationship?,,unk,"BACKGROUND: Preliminary evidence suggests that children are just as likely to become infected with SARS-CoV-2 as adults but are less prone to developing severe clinical conditions. However, there are pediatric inflammatory conditions that have also been encountered. The aim of this report is to determine whether there is a relationship between COVID-19 and severe infections in the ear, nose, throat, and deep cervical area (ENT) in pediatric populations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A compilation was made of all the cases of ENT area infections in the pediatric population per month attended to at the Niño Jesús University Children's Hospital from January 2010 to June 2020. Endemic channels and dispersion analysis were designed to analyze the incidence presented in the year 2020, compared to what was expected based on historical data from 2010 to 2019. Then, an epidemiological interview was conducted of the close contacts of COVID-19 of the children who presented a severe ENT infection in 2020. Finally, a serological test of IgG antibodies was performed on all of them to find out if they had overcome the COVID- 19. RESULTS: 620 patients from 1022 were eligible for the study. We observed a significant outbreak in the incidence of complicated mastoiditis and deep cervical infections with complications in the year 2020 (13 patients) linked to the COVID-19 pandemic. From these patients, 54% had been confirmed or had high suspicion of close contact with COVID-19.15.4% of children were positive in serological tests for IgG antibodies. CONCLUSION: There has been a significant increase in mastoiditis and deep cervical infections with complications in the first four months of 2020, which constitutes an outbreak. A considerable number (54%) of these complicated infections were related to close contact with COVID-19. Still, only 15.4% were positive in serological tests for IgG antibodies, so we cannot establish a direct categorical relationship. The limitations in primary care due to a shortage of human resources in dealing with the pandemic's initial onslaught and changes in help-seeking behavior could explain increased complicated infections.",,"Enrique, Guillén-Lozada; Margarita, Bartolomé-Benito; Ángel, Moreno-Juara; Saturnino, Santos-Santos; María Jesús, Domínguez-González de Rivera",Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,,233256532.0,,332

However, a newborn during the 2020-2021 period need not experience the same level of adult mortality found in 2020-2021 because there may be zero COVID-19 related deaths when the newborn reaches adulthood. Thus, life expectancy lost due to COVID-19 cannot be found simply by incorporating excess deaths due to COVID-19 and re-doing the life table computations because: (1) we know that the COVID-19 deaths need not occur every year for the next 20-25 years; and (2) once an adult, a newborn in 2021/2022 need not experience the same mortality rate that current middle and older aged COVID-19 patients experience. Using U.S. data as an example, we estimate an average of 29.68 years of life was lost to those aged 18-64 who died from COVID-19 in the U.S., noting that 74 % of the reported deaths of 18-64 occurred among 50-64 years and 10 % below 40 years.

The accuracy of US is in the same range as the linear interaction energy (LIE) and fast pulling of ligand (FPL) methods. In detail, the correlation coefficient between US and experiments does not differ from FPL and is slightly smaller than LIE. The root mean square error of US simulations is smaller than that of LIE. Moreover, US is better than FPL and poorer than LIE in classifying SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors owing to the reciever operating characteristic–area under the curve analysis. Furthermore, the US simulations also provide detailed insights on unbinding pathways of ligands from the binding cleft of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The residues Cys44, Thr45, Ser46, Leu141, Asn142, Gly143, Glu166, Leu167, Pro168, Ala191, Gln192 and Ala193 probably play an important role in the ligand dissociation.

tv5sy09a,WHO,Time for Solidarity: Liturgical Time in Disaster Capitalism,,unk,"This article identifies the upheaval of many people's experience of time during the COVID-19 pandemic as part of a larger phenomenon of the 24/7 temporality that can be seen to contribute to the environmental destruction and social fragmentation typical of disaster capitalism. It then proposes liturgical temporality as an alternative to 24/7 temporality, framing it as a fitting context for the cultivation of solidarity between human beings and between human beings and the natural world. It argues that modern Jewish and Christian theologies of Sabbath-keeping as a mode of liturgical and ethical praxis have articulated a liberative vision for shared liturgical temporality but have not paid sufficient attention to concrete, collective modes of liturgical time keeping that could contend with the all-encompassing reality of 24/7 life. It concludes by discussing three ways that a more robust spirituality and praxis of liturgical time could support the cultivation of solidarity: a sense of the present that is mindful of the past and future, the invitation of practitioners into a shared story, and meaningful repetition toward the appropriation of a vision of redemption and liberation for human and non-human life.

To investigate the potential impact of COVID-19 on obsessive–compulsive (OC) symptoms, we utilized a frequent sampling prospective design to assess changes in OC symptoms between April 2020 and January 2021. We examined in a broad clinical and non-clinical sample whether baseline risk (e.g., emotion dysregulation, anxiety sensitivity, intolerance of uncertainty) and protective (e.g., resilience) factors would predict OC symptom changes, and whether coping strategies would mediate week-to-week changes in COVID-19 impact and OC symptoms. Emotion dysregulation was associated with greater likelihood of OC symptom worsening, whereas resilience was associated with lower likelihood. Longitudinal mediation analyses revealed that coping strategies were not significant mediators; however, changes in adaptive coping were associated with subsequent-week OC symptom reductions. Regardless of perceived COVID-19 impact, implementing adaptive coping strategies may prospectively reduce OC symptoms.

Each individual has a chance to participate and influence any discussion. Even with all the freedom, people’s behavior falls under patterns that are observed in numerous situations. In this paper, we propose a methodology that defines and searches for common communication patterns in topical networks on Twitter. We analyze clusters according to four traits: number of nodes the cluster has, their degree and betweenness centrality values, number of node types, and whether the cluster is open or closed. We find that cluster structures can be defined as (a) fixed, meaning that they are repeated across datasets/topics following uniform rules, or (b) variable if they follow an underlying rule regardless of their size. This approach allows us to classify 90% of all conversation clusters, with the number varying by topic. An increase in cluster size often results in difficulties finding topological shape rules;however, these types of clusters tend to exhibit rules regarding their node relationships in the form of centralization. Most individuals do not enter large-scale discussions on Twitter, meaning that the simplicity of communication clusters implies repetition. In general, power laws apply for the influencer connection distribution (degree centrality) even in topical networks.",,"Mijat, Kustudic Bowen Xue Zhong Huifen Tan Lijing Niu Ben",Electronics,https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics10172151,239712662.0,,202

No primarily antifibrotic medications are used to treat patients with heart failure. There is some evidence that PFD has antifibrotic actions in various animal models of cardiac disease and a phase II trial on patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction has yielded positive results.

However, most research to date has focused on arts-based interventions and has not tested arts and cultural engagement in large population-based longitudinal studies. This study investigated whether arts and cultural engagement reduced reportedly antisocial or criminalized behaviors in two large nationally representative cohorts, the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (n = 10,610; 50% female, 72% White, age range = 11–21 mean = 15.07) and the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (n = 15,214; 50% female, 73% White, age range = 13–16 mean = 14.38). Structural equation modelling also allowed exploration of two potential mechanisms that might link arts and cultural engagement to reportedly antisocial or criminalized behaviors (self-control and attitudes towards these behaviors). More arts and cultural engagement was associated with fewer reportedly antisocial or criminalized behaviors, better self-control scores, and fewer positive perceptions of reportedly antisocial or criminalized behaviors concurrently and one to two years later.

bok07st0,Medline,The Design and Preliminary Experience with a Virtual Diversity Visiting Student Acting Internship in Radiology for Underrepresented Minority Medical Students.,10.1016/j.acra.2021.02.021,unk,"OBJECTIVE Benefits of a diverse physician workforce are numerous and the impact of a lack of diversity has been highlighted with the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the commitment of professional societies such as the American College of Radiology to diversity in Radiology, the field and its residency training programs remain the least diverse. With COVID-19 related suspension of in-person medical student rotations, our Department of Radiology redesigned and implemented a virtual radiology internship for underrepresented minority (URM) medical students. METHODS A four-week virtual radiology internship was designed to provide clinical exposure to radiology and to allow students to gain an understanding of what a career in radiology entails. Course design included videoconference patient care sessions, didactic lectures, online modules, mentoring, and extra-clinical curriculum. Feedback from students was collected using online surveys assessing pre- and postcourse attitudes and understanding of a career in radiology and the students' perceived aptitude for such a career, as well as course component evaluation. RESULTS Three participants were enrolled in the inaugural clerkship. All noted exceptional educational course content and ample opportunities to build connections with faculty and residents-with mentoring seen as the highlight of the course. All indicated a significant shift in perception of the field and in declaring interest in pursuing a career in radiology. CONCLUSION Virtual radiology internship for URM students is a feasible paradigm to address potential impediments to diversification of the specialty by both engaging interested URM medical students in a career in radiology and arming them with the tools for a successful application to radiology residency.",2021-03-24,"Dodelzon, Katerina; Belfi, Lily; Schweitzer, Andrew D; Lamparello, Nicole; Legasto, Alan C; McGinty, Geraldine; Spottswood, Stephanie; Min, Robert J; Babagbemi, Kemi",Academic radiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acra.2021.02.021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33773896/,232406860.0,2021.0,255

OBJECTIVE: To adapt an evidence-based resiliency intervention to address FOR among cancer survivors. METHODS: A multidisciplinary team of researchers, clinicians, and patient stakeholders followed an iterative intervention adaptation process (ORBIT). In Step 1, we sought to define key FOR management skills through a literature review and feedback from stakeholders. In Step 2, we integrated findings into a treatment manual and refined procedures for in-person delivery to groups of cancer survivors, defined as adults who had completed primary cancer treatment for non-metastatic cancer. In Step 3, we conducted a single arm trial to assess initial acceptability and change in FOR severity with 23 cancer survivors (N=4 intervention groups). In Step 4, we conducted additional qualitative interviews with 28 cancer survivors (N=6 focus groups stratified by FOR severity, N=15 individual interviews) to define adaptive and maladaptive strategies for coping with FOR and to identify preferences for delivery. In Step 5, we refined the treatment manual and procedures for testing in a future pilot randomized feasibility trial. RESULTS: We identified critical feedback using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. The single arm trial suggested preliminary feasibility and sustained reductions in FOR severity, yet need for refinement (i.e., eligibility, delivery modality), prompting additional qualitative interviews for further targeting. The resulting intervention (IN FOCUS) is comprised of virtual, synchronous, group-delivered sessions that offer an integrated approach to FOR management by teaching cognitive-behavioral techniques, meditation, relaxation training, adaptive health behaviors, and positive psychology skills. Sessions are targeted by applying skills to FOR and associated healthcare engagement. CONCLUSIONS: IN FOCUS is a targeted intervention for teaching mind-body resiliency skills to groups of cancer survivors with elevated FOR. Next steps are testing feasibility in a pilot randomized trial.",2022-01-27,"Hall, Daniel L.; Yeh, Gloria Y.; O'Cleirigh, Conall; Peppercorn, Jeffrey; Wagner, Lynne I.; Denninger, John; Bullock, Andrea J.; Mizrach, Helen R.; Goshe, Brett; Cheung, Tina; Li, Raissa; Markowitz, Alexandros; Park, Elyse R.",Glob Adv Health Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35237466/; https://doi.org/10.1177/21649561221074690,246378832.0,2022.0,312

lu9yz6v8,WHO,A novel circulated air curtain system to confine the transmission of exhaled contaminants: A numerical and experimental investigation,,unk,"Air curtain is an efficient device for cutting off airflow and confining contaminants. Inspired by the ability, a circulated air curtain composed of end-to-end plane jets generated by a relay of air pillars is proposed to confine exhaled contaminants in this study. Furthermore, the optimization study of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is conducted to explore cutting-off performance and find better design parameters under different conditions, i.e., human-curtain distance, enclosure shape, jet velocity from air pillar, and exhalation modes. The multidirectional blockage and vortex-like rotative transmission routes of exhaled airflow are observed when air curtain exists. Results indicate that contaminants are concentrated around the source. The average mole fraction of exhaled contaminants outside air curtain under different human-curtain distance decreases 4.3%-19.6% compared to mixing ventilation with same flux. Shortening the human-curtain distance can improve the performance of air curtain and may change the direction of exhaled airflow. Moreover, It has better performance when the enclosure shape is close to a circle. Higher jet velocity is better for improving the confinement performance, but the trend is not very obvious as velocity increases. For exhalation modes, it is more challenging to control exhaled contaminants for intense exhalation activity (such as coughing) in steady simulation, but results in transient simulation show better performance when coughing only once. These results can provide a reference for the subsequent design and improvement in applying air curtain in hospital wards or other places, especially during the period of flu outbreak.

This study presents the design of new chitinase inhibitors from a known hydrolysis intermediate. Firstly, a bioinformatic analysis of Aspergillus fumigatus chitinase B1 (AfChiB1) and chitotriosidase (CHIT1) by length and conservation was done to obtain consensus sequences, and molecular homology models of fungi and human chitinases were built to determine their structural differences. We explored the octahydroisoindolone scaffold as a potential new antifungal series by means of its structural and electronic features. Therefore, we evaluated several synthesis-safe octahydroisoindolone derivatives by molecular docking and evaluated their AfChiB1 interaction profile. Additionally, compounds with the best interaction profile (1–5) were docked within the CHIT1 catalytic site to evaluate their selectivity over AfChiB1. Furthermore, we considered the interaction energy (MolDock score) and a lipophilic parameter (aLogP) for the selection of the best candidates. Based on these descriptors, we constructed a mathematical model for the IC(50) prediction of our candidates (60–200 μM), using experimental known inhibitors of AfChiB1.

This can adversely affect nurses both psychologically and physically. Burnout is caused by prolonged stress during work. In the nursing profession, burnout is common, potentially affecting the well-being of nurses and their productivity. The identification of factors that may contribute to maintaining mental health and reducing burnout among frontline nurses during a pandemic is essential. PurposeThe purpose of this study was to explore how personal resilience, social support, and organizational support impact burnout among frontline staff nurses. MethodsThis study involved 129 registered nurses from a COVID-19 designated hospital using four standardized scales. ResultsThe mean age of the respondents was 29.46 years (standard deviation = 4.89). The mean number of years respondents worked in this organization was 5.60 years and the nursing profession was 4.16 years. Most of the respondents were female and held a bachelors degree in nursing. Multiple regression analysis was performed to predict burnout. Burnout was statistically significantly predicted by the multiple regression model (R2 = .420, F (3, 125) = 10.941, p < .0001; adjusted R2 = .406). Personal resilience, social support, and organizational support added statistically significantly to the prediction of burnout (p < .05). ConclusionFindings from multiple regression analysis showed that nurses with low resilience and those who perceived inadequate social and organizational support had a higher risk of reporting more burnout. As a result of a bivariate analysis, there was no significant correlation between nurse variables and burnout level, except for age, which was negatively correlated with burnout level. Accordingly, young nurses tend to experience burnout, and nurse directors and managers must address this problem.",,"Daghash, Hanan",Unknown,,245704835.0,,288

It has been described as the most severe global health disaster of modern times by the United Nations. No doubt such a major crisis influences what citizens think of different policies, and how they become politically active, not to mention, the forceful emotional experiences that the Covid-19 pandemic brings. This study evaluates how emotions affect support for policies related to restricting the spread of the virus and economic assistance, and how emotions affect intentions to engage politically. In an experiment (N = 1,072), we manipulated emotional reactions to threat by highlighting different aspects of the pandemic. Our findings show that different experimental treatments elicit different emotions, and that fear, anxiety, and anger are all related to policy support and political action intentions, but in different ways. Fear and anger predict support for restrictive policies to limit the spread of the virus, while anxiety predicts support for economic policies. Anger and anxiety, but not fear, increase intentions to engage politically. Hence, we find support for a mechanism where different aspects of the Covid-19 crisis evoke different emotional reactions, which in turn affects policy support and political actions differently.",,"Renström, Emma A.; Bäck, Hanna",Journal of Applied Social Psychology,,236297474.0,,199

A few also added new shared streets for citizens to recreate. This large and unprecedented change in the ability of residents to use green space provides an important case for assessing how emergency planning processes might differentially impact minority groups. Methods Using the case of park closures and shared streets expansion in Denver, Colorado in March and April of 2020, this analysis evaluates how walking time and density of use at parks changed for different minority and income groups based on estimating park visits for residential blocks. Results The analysis demonstrates that minority and low income groups were not disproportionately impacted by initial closures. Shared streets provide net decreases across the city in terms of travel time and density for recreational space usage, though there is some indication benefits were not equally distributed.

w2kz7qvr,WHO,Fleeing through the mind's eye: Desire thinking as a maladaptive coping mechanism among specific online activities,,unk,"INTRODUCTION: Desire thinking is defined as a voluntary cognitive activity aimed at imaginatively and verbally elaborating a future scenario of performing a desired behavior. Although not problematic per se, desire thinking can become dysfunctional if it is used to regulate negative mood states and due to its ability to induce craving. This study tests a mediation model where desire thinking is hypothesized to mediate the association between emotional reactivity and craving among specific online activities. METHODS: The study comprised an online survey that was completed by 925 participants who indicated that their first-choice online activity was one out of social-networks use, shopping, gaming, gambling, or pornography viewing. In this sample, a structural equation model was tested where negative emotional reactivity, desire thinking, and craving were latently modelled in this serial order. RESULTS: Results indicated that higher levels in negative emotional reactivity significantly predicted higher desire thinking tendencies, which in turn significantly predicted higher cravings for online activities. The direct path between negative reactivity and craving was not significant. Further, our results support the two-factorial structure of a German version of the Desire Thinking Questionnaire (Caselli & Spada, 2011). DISCUSSION: The findings show that desire thinking might be initiated as an attempt to regulate negative affective states. This highlights its possible role as a maladaptive coping mechanism in the context of specific online activities due to the resulting craving responses, which in turn could promote the emergence of unwanted behaviors.",,"Brandtner, Annika; Brand, Matthias",Addict Behav,,233477607.0,,239
09kwu3x3,Medline,Pressure exposure and catheter impingement affect the recorded pressure in the Manoscan 360™ system.,10.1111/nmo.13329,unk,"BACKGROUND The accuracy of pressure measurements by Manoscan high-resolution manometry (HRM) system is affected by pressure drift (PD). The PD is partly related to temperature and study duration, but other factors that contribute to errant pressure recording have not been systematically evaluated. The aim of this study was to investigate and quantify contributing factors to pressure recording error. METHODS In total, 660 in vitro experiments were conducted on seven HRM catheters to determine the effects of sustained pressure exposure, catheter impingement, temperature, duration of study, and immersion in saline or acid on recorded pressure and PD. KEY RESULTS At room temperature and without application of pressure, the PD was negligible. Application of sustained pressure significantly increased PD and catheter impingement of even 15° produced remarkable increases in the recorded pressure as well as post-recording PD. There was significant variability across sensors in their propensity to develop PD with temperature. Body (37°C) and freezing (0°C) temperatures resulted in significantly higher absolute value of PD in the opposite algebraic direction, respectively (for individual sensors). Although the overall trend was for higher PD with increasing temperature, some of the pressure sensors demonstrated inherently negative PD at body temperature. CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES In addition to the known effects of temperature, both sustained pressure exposure and catheter impingement significantly affect the recorded pressure and the magnitude of the PD observed at the end of the recording. These effects can be substantial enough to result in erroneous manometric diagnoses.",,"Babaei, A; Szabo, A; Yorio, S D; Massey, B T",Neurogastroenterology and motility : the official journal of the European Gastrointestinal Motility Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/nmo.13329; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29520927/,3800059.0,,243

School nurses are primary health care professionals who lead health care in schools and practice in a holistic manner to address the needs of schoolchildren and school personnel. There is rising mental health concerns of frontline health care professionals with anxiety and panic disorders, somatic symptoms and feeling isolated. No studies use a qualitative study approach to document community frontline school nursing professionals’ experiences and challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, understanding the school nurses’ experiences and challenges to fight against COVID-19 in the communities is important. PURPOSE: This study aims to explore the experiences of school nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong. METHODS: A qualitative study design adopted the principles of thematic analysis. Nineteen school nurses were recruited to participate in individual semi-structured interviews and shared their roles and responsibilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. FINDINGS: Three themes indicated the school nurses’ expand professional responsibilities to fight against COVID-19 emerged from the data analysis. These were ‘Managing Stress’, ‘Navigating the School Through the Pandemic’, and ‘Raising the Profile of the School Nurse Professional’. DISCUSSION: Findings reveal the important role of school nursing professionals in minimising the community-wide risk posed by pandemics and the need to integrate them into planning and implementation of school health policies and guidelines in the primary health care system.

Wikipedia bibliometrics during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic,10.1093/gigascience/giab095,cc-by,"BACKGROUND: With the COVID-19 pandemic’s outbreak, millions flocked to Wikipedia for updated information. Amid growing concerns regarding an “infodemic,” ensuring the quality of information is a crucial vector of public health. Investigating whether and how Wikipedia remained up to date and in line with science is key to formulating strategies to counter misinformation. Using citation analyses, we asked which sources informed Wikipedia’s COVID-19–related articles before and during the pandemic’s first wave (January–May 2020). RESULTS: We found that coronavirus-related articles referenced trusted media outlets and high-quality academic sources. Regarding academic sources, Wikipedia was found to be highly selective in terms of what science was cited. Moreover, despite a surge in COVID-19 preprints, Wikipedia had a clear preference for open-access studies published in respected journals and made little use of preprints. Building a timeline of English-language COVID-19 articles from 2001–2020 revealed a nuanced trade-off between quality and timeliness. It further showed how pre-existing articles on key topics related to the virus created a framework for integrating new knowledge. Supported by a rigid sourcing policy, this “scientific infrastructure” facilitated contextualization and regulated the influx of new information. Last, we constructed a network of DOI-Wikipedia articles, which showed the landscape of pandemic-related knowledge on Wikipedia and how academic citations create a web of shared knowledge supporting topics like COVID-19 drug development. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding how scientific research interacts with the digital knowledge-sphere during the pandemic provides insight into how Wikipedia can facilitate access to science. It also reveals how, aided by what we term its “citizen encyclopedists,” it successfully fended off COVID-19 disinformation and how this unique model may be deployed in other contexts.",2022-01-12,"Benjakob, Omer; Aviram, Rona; Sobel, Jonathan Aryeh",Gigascience,https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giab095; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35022700/,245907295.0,2022.0,269

We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the prone maneuver in decreasing the risk of intubation and increasing the odds of favorable events. METHODS We prospectively evaluated 66 subjects with COVID-19-related moderate ARDS who were admitted to the ICU; treated with high-flow nasal cannula, noninvasive ventilation, a reservoir mask, or a nasal cannula; and subjected to awake prone maneuvers from March 1, 2020-August 30, 2020. The following factors were recorded at ICU admission: age, sex, prior illness, simplified acute physiology score 3, body mass index, and changes in gas exchange after and before prone positioning. Subjects were divided into a group of responders and nonresponders according to a 20% increase in the PaO2 /FIO2 ratio before and after the maneuver. The need for intubation within 48 h of the start of the maneuver was also evaluated. We also analyzed the differences in mortality, ICU length of stay, hospital length of stay, and duration of mechanical ventilation. A generalized estimating equation model was applied to preprone and postprone means. To control for confounding factors, multivariate Poisson regression was applied. RESULTS Forty-one subjects age 54.1 y ± 12.9 were enrolled. Responders showed increased SpO2 (P < .001), PaO2 (P < .001), and PaO2 /FIO2 ratios (P < .001) with the maneuver and reduced breathing frequency. Responders had shorter lengths of stay in the ICU (P < .001) and hospital (P < .003), lower intubation rates at 48 h (P < .012), fewer days of ventilation (P < .02), and lower mortality (P < .001).

Acute organ failure is a major risk factor of morbidity and mortality in surgical patients and develops primarily as a consequence of a dysregulated inflammatory response and insufficient tissue perfusion. Neurological dysfunction, myocardial ischemia, acute kidney injury, respiratory failure, intestinal dysfunction, and hepatic impairment are among the most serious complications impacting patient outcome and recovery. Pre-, intra-, and postoperative arrangements, such as enhanced recovery after surgery programs, can contribute to lowering the occurrence of organ dysfunction, and mortality rates have improved with the advent of specialized intensive care units and advances in procedures relating to extracorporeal organ support. However, no specific pharmacological therapies have proven effective in the prevention or reversal of perioperative organ injury. Therefore, understanding the underlying mechanisms of organ dysfunction is essential to identify novel treatment strategies to improve perioperative care and outcomes for surgical patients. This review focuses on recent knowledge of pathophysiological and molecular pathways leading to perioperative organ injury.

However, regional anesthesia is slowly finding viable applications in this field. This review aims at providing an update on the current practice of regional anesthesia techniques outside of the operating theatre. RECENT FINDINGS Some anesthetic departments have implemented the use of regional anesthesia in novel applications outside of the operating room. In most cases, it remains an adjunct to general anesthesia but is sometimes used as the sole anesthetic technique. The use of the paravertebral block during radiofrequency ablation of different tumors is a recent application in interventional radiology. In emergency medicine, regional anesthesia is gaining traction in analgesia for trauma patients.

12fj1wwy,BioRxiv; WHO,Autoantibodies against Progranulin and IL-1 receptor antagonist due to immunogenic posttranslational isoforms contribute to hyperinflammation in critically ill COVID-19,10.1101/2021.04.23.441188,biorxiv,"Hyperinflammation is frequently observed in patients with severe COVID-19. Inadequate and defective IFN type I responses against SARS-CoV-2, associated with autoantibodies in a proportion of patients, lead to severe courses of disease. In addition, hyperactive responses of the humoral immune system have been described. In the current study we investigated a possible role of neutralizing autoantibodies against antiinflammatory mediators. Plasma from adult patients with severe and critical COVID-19 was screened by ELISA for antibodies against PGRN, IL-1-Ra, IL-10, IL-18BP, IL-22BP, IL-36-Ra, CD40, IFN-α2, IFN-γ, IFN-ω and serpinB1. Autoantibodies were characterized and the antigens were analyzed for immunogenic alterations. In a discovery cohort with severe to critical COVID-19 high titers of PGRN-autoantibodies were detected in 11 of 30 (36.7%), and of IL-1-Ra-autoantibodies in 14 of 30 (46.7%) patients. In a validation cohort of 64 patients with critical COVID-19 high-titer PGRN-Abs were detected in 25 (39%) and IL-1-Ra-Abs in 32 of 64 patients (50%). PGRN-Abs and IL-1-Ra-Abs belonged to IgM and several IgG subclasses. In separate cohorts with non-critical COVID-19, PGRN-Abs and IL-1-Ra-Abs were detected in low frequency (i.e. in < 5% of patients) and at low titers. Neither PGRN-nor IL-1-Ra-Abs were found in 40 healthy controls vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 or 188 unvaccinated healthy controls. PGRN-Abs were not cross-reactive against SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins nor against IL-1-Ra. Plasma levels of both free PGRN and free IL-1-Ra were significantly decreased in autoantibody-positive patients compared to Ab-negative and non-COVID-19 controls. In vitro PGRN-Abs from patients functionally reduced PGRN-dependent inhibition of TNF-α signaling, and IL-1-Ra-Abs from patients reduced IL-1-Ra- or anakinra-dependent inhibition of IL-1ß signaling. The pSer81 hyperphosphorylated PGRN isoform was exclusively detected in patients with high-titer PGRN-Abs; likewise, a hyperphosphorylated IL-1-Ra isoform was only found in patients with high-titer IL-1-Ra-Abs. Thr111 was identified as the hyperphophorylated amino acid of IL-1-Ra. In longitudinally collected samples hyperphosphorylated isoforms of both PGRN and IL-1-Ra emerged transiently, and preceded the appearance of autoantibodies. In hospitalized patients, the presence of IL-1-Ra-Abs or IL-1-Ra-Abs in combination with PGRN-Abs was associated with a higher morbidity and mortality. To conclude, neutralizing autoantibodies to IL-1-Ra and PGRN occur in a significant portion of patients with critical COVID-19, with a concomitant decrease in circulating free PGRN and IL-1-Ra, indicative of a misdirected, proinflammatory autoimmune response. The break of self-tolerance is likely caused by atypical hyperphosphorylated isoforms of both antigens, whose appearances precede autoantibody induction. Our data suggest that these immunogenic secondary modifications are induced by the SARS-CoV-2-infection itself or the inflammatory environment evoked by the infection and predispose for a critical course of COVID-19.",2021-10-20,"Thurner, Lorenz; Fadle, Natalie; Bewarder, Moritz; Kos, Igor; Regitz, Evi; Thurner, Bernhard; Fischer, Yvan; Cetin, Onur; Rixecker, Torben; Hoffmann, Marie-Christin; Preuss, Klaus-Dieter; Schormann, Claudia; Neumann, Frank; Hartmann, Sylvia; Bock, Theresa; Kaddu-Mulindwa, Dominic; Bette, Birgit; Roemer, Klaus; Bittenbring, Joerg Thomas; Christofyllakis, Konstantinos; Bick, Angelika; Lesan, Vadim; Abdi, Zanir; Mang, Sebastian; Becker, André; Metz, Carlos; Seiler, Frederik; Lehmann, Johannes; Agne, Philipp; Adams, Thomas; Link, Andreas; Werner, Christian; Thiel-Bodenstaff, Angela; Reichert, Matthias; Danziger, Guy; Roth, Sophie; Papan, Cihan; Pilch, Jan; Pfuhl, Thorsten; Wuchter, Patrick; Herr, Christian; Lohse, Stefan; Schrezenmeier, Hubert; Boehm, Michael; Langer, Frank; Gäbelein, Gereon; Friesenhahn-Ochs, Bettina; Kessel, Christoph; Foell, Dirk; Bals, Robert; Lammert, Frank; Körper, Sixten; Rissland, Jürgen; Lensch, Christian; Stilgenbauer, Stephan; Becker, Sören L.; Smola, Sigrun; Krawczyk, Marcin; Lepper, Philipp M.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.23.441188,239460211.0,2021.0,419

Patients with hematological disorders are known to be at high risk of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19, and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been rapidly developed. Although mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are reported to be effective, efficacy in patients with hematological malignancies who have received anti-CD20 antibody treatment remains unclear. Here, we prospectively evaluated the efficacy of BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in patients with B-cell malignancies treated with anti-CD20 antibody. We first evaluated antibody titers in 12 healthy volunteers (median age 75.5 years, range 57-82) and three lymphoma patients undergoing R-CHOP therapy (73, 81, and 81 years old) who had received 2 vaccine doses of BNT162b2 at pre-vaccination, 21 days after the first dose and 14 days after the second dose of vaccination. IgG antibody titers for S1 protein were measured in serum samples by ELISA. In healthy control subjects, titers were clearly increased. In contrast, no patient treated with R-CHOP developed antibodies even after the second vaccination (Figure A). To determine the SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell reactivity in these three patients, we evaluated interferon (IFN)-γ response to the SARS-CoV-2 spike peptide before and after the second vaccination dose, and detected IFN-γ responses after vaccination in all three patients (Figure B). Next, to investigate the duration of the effect of anti-CD20 antibody on antibody production to BNT162b2, we enrolled 36 patients (median age 74 years, range 50-87) who had received the final dose of anti-CD20 antibody 48-1320 (median 571) days before vaccination. S1 antibody titers were measured 14 days after the second dose of vaccination. Diagnoses included diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n = 21), follicular lymphoma (n = 9), lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (n = 3), and mantle cell lymphoma (n = 3). Thirty-four patients had received rituximab-based and 2 had received obinutuzumab-based therapy, with a median of 6 (range 3-20) courses. No patient had received any chemotherapy after the last anti-CD20 antibody dose. No patient vaccinated within close to one year or sooner after the last anti-CD20 antibody administration showed an increase in titers. Furthermore, titers in most patients were lower than in healthy volunteers even among those vaccinated more than three years after the last administration (Figure C). Finally, we investigated surrogate markers of antibody production ability. We found no relationship between the percent of B-cells (CD19-positive cells) and S1 antibody titers (Figure D), whereas all patients (n = 9) with total IgG level below lower normal limit (< 870 mg/dl) had low S1 antibody titers (< 0.16), below the lowest optical density (O.D.) value in healthy donors (Figure E). These findings indicate that the antibody-mediated response to vaccination in patients following treatment with anti-CD20 antibody was considerably impaired for an extended time. Alternative protection strategies for these patients are therefore warranted. Although T-cell responses were detected, we recommend that these patients continue to wear a face mask and wash their hands to prevent COVID-19 even after vaccination.

n48qo5ny,Medline; PMC,Harnessing the Power of Mast Cells in unconventional Immunotherapy Strategies and Vaccine Adjuvants,10.3390/cells9122713,cc-by,"Mast cells are long-lived, granular, myeloid-derived leukocytes that have significant protective and repair functions in tissues. Mast cells sense disruptions in the local microenvironment and are first responders to physical, chemical and biological insults. When activated, mast cells release growth factors, proteases, chemotactic proteins and cytokines thereby mobilizing and amplifying the reactions of the innate and adaptive immune system. Mast cells are therefore significant regulators of homeostatic functions and may be essential in microenvironmental changes during pathogen invasion and disease. During infection by helminths, bacteria and viruses, mast cells release antimicrobial factors to facilitate pathogen expulsion and eradication. Mast cell-derived proteases and growth factors protect tissues from insect/snake bites and exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Finally, mast cells release mediators that promote wound healing in the inflammatory, proliferative and remodelling stages. Since mast cells have such a powerful repertoire of functions, targeting mast cells may be an effective new strategy for immunotherapy of disease and design of novel vaccine adjuvants. In this review, we will examine how certain strategies that specifically target and activate mast cells can be used to treat and resolve infections, augment vaccines and heal wounds. Although these strategies may be protective in certain circumstances, mast cells activation may be deleterious if not carefully controlled and any therapeutic strategy using mast cell activators must be carefully explored.",2020-12-18,"Willows, Steven; Kulka, Marianna",Cells,https://doi.org/10.3390/cells9122713; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33352850/,229685688.0,2020.0,219
zqxycvgy,Medline,"Features and functioning of Data Abstraction Assistant, a software application for data abstraction during systematic reviews.",10.1002/jrsm.1326,unk,"INTRODUCTION During systematic reviews, data abstraction is labor- and time-intensive and error-prone. Existing data abstraction systems do not track specific locations and contexts of abstracted information. To address this limitation, we developed a software application, the Data Abstraction Assistant (DAA) and surveyed early users about their experience using DAA. FEATURES OF DAA We designed DAA to encompass three essential features: (1) a platform for indicating the source of abstracted information, (2) compatibility with a variety of data abstraction systems, and (3) user-friendliness. HOW DAA FUNCTIONS DAA (1) converts source documents from PDF to HTML format (to enable tracking of source of abstracted information), (2) transmits the HTML to the data abstraction system, and (3) displays the HTML in an area adjacent to the data abstraction form in the data abstraction system. The data abstractor can mark locations on the HTML that DAA associates with items on the data abstraction form. EXPERIENCES OF EARLY USERS OF DAA When we surveyed 52 early users of DAA, 83% reported that using DAA was either very or somewhat easy; 71% are very or somewhat likely to use DAA in the future; and 87% are very or somewhat likely to recommend that others use DAA in the future. DISCUSSION DAA, a user-friendly software for linking abstracted data with their exact source, is likely to be a very useful tool in the toolbox of systematic reviewers. DAA facilitates verification of abstracted data and provides an audit trail that is crucial for reproducible research.",,"Jap, Jens; Saldanha, Ian J; Smith, Bryant T; Lau, Joseph; Schmid, Christopher H; Li, Tianjing",Research synthesis methods,https://doi.org/10.1002/jrsm.1326; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30325115/,53501498.0,,247

This observational study aimed to identify demographic and morphologic factors associated with difficult FB intubation. METHODS We recruited 420 adult elective surgery patients undergoing tracheal intubation during general anesthesia. Patients characteristics were recorded including age, sex, weight, height, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status, history of snoring, obstructive sleep apnea, Mallampati score, upper lip bite test score, neck circumference and skinfold thickness, maximal neck flexion and extension angles, absence of teeth, Cormack and Lehane grade, presence of blood or secretions during intubation, as well as the inter-incisor, thyromental, sternothyroid, and manubriomental distances. The time (duration) needed to complete intubation (primary endpoint) and the number of attempts needed were correlated with these patient characteristics in a multivariable analysis. RESULTS Intubation was successful on the first attempt in 409/420 patients (97%). Seven patients (1.7%) needed more than one attempt. Failure to intubate with the FB occurred in four patients (1%). A correlation was found between intubation duration and visibility impaired by secretions or blood (P < 0.001), higher neck skinfold thickness (P < 0.001), and larger endotracheal tube diameter (relative to a constant 5.5 mm FB; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The presence of secretions or blood that impair FB glottic visualization, a larger diameter endotracheal tube on the same size FB, as well as higher neck skinfold thickness may prolong the duration of FB intubation under general anesthesia.

CM4FP data provide a picture of the complete supply environment and how consumers experience it. Study objectives were to 1) test a ring-fenced census approach consisting of an outlet census in a defined geographical area and a household survey in a smaller inner ring, to comprehensively map the total FP market in a local geography; 2) explore FP supply market dynamism through longitudinal data collection from contraceptive outlets; and 3) test a methodology for directly linking household and outlet data to measure the relationship between contraceptive demand and supply. Methods: Data were collected from study sites in Nigeria, Kenya, and Uganda from 2019 to 2020. Longitudinal outlet census data and repeated cross-sectional household survey data from women ages 18-49 were collected at three quarterly time points. Outlets were located in an outer ring geography to encompass locations likely visited by women sampled from a smaller inner ring. Data from women who received a contraceptive method in the past 12 months were linked to data for the outlet from which they received the method. Results: Datasets include product audits for 22,380 individual FP products, collected from a total of 1,836 outlets across 12 study sites. The datasets also contain data from 11,536 female respondents, of whom 1,975 were successfully matched to the outlet where they most recently obtained their method.

Taif is a small city in the western region of KSA with a population of 689,000 and 2 main hospitals (KFMC &amp; KASH) which also serve rural areas close to Taif city. A total of 36 physicians practiced telemedicine, only 25 physicians accepted to participate in this study. RESULTS: Thirty-six percent of the responders believed that telemedicine could improve the effectiveness of therapeutic intervention and 44% believed that the quality of care was enhanced using telemedicine. Difficulty in reaching the correct diagnosis due to the lack of physical examination was one of the disadvantages that faced the participants. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine should be part of medical services but should not completely replace physicians' personal interaction. Telemedicine could be continued for stable remotely residing patients even after the COVID-19 pandemic.",,"Mubaraki, Adnan A; Alrabie, Aeshah D; Sibyani, Afnan K; Aljuaid, Raghad S; Bajaber, Ameerah S; Mubaraki, Murad A",Saudi Med J,,230658384.0,,189

In addition to the limitations of antimicrobial drugs associated with low transportation rate, water solubility, oral bioavailability and stability, inefficient drug targeting, considerable toxicity, and limited patient compliance, the major cause for their inefficiency is the antimicrobial resistance of microorganisms. In this context, the risk of a pre-antibiotic era is a real possibility. For this reason, the research focus has shifted toward the discovery and development of novel and alternative antimicrobial agents that could overcome the challenges associated with conventional drugs. Nanotechnology is a possible alternative, as there is significant evidence of the broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity of nanomaterials and nanoparticles in particular. Moreover, owing to their considerable advantages regarding their efficient cargo dissolving, entrapment, encapsulation, or surface attachment, the possibility of forming antimicrobial groups for specific targeting and destruction, biocompatibility and biodegradability, low toxicity, and synergistic therapy, polymeric nanoparticles have received considerable attention as potential antimicrobial drug delivery agents. In this context, the aim of this paper is to provide an up-to-date overview of the most recent studies investigating polymeric nanoparticles designed for antimicrobial therapies, describing both their targeting strategies and their effects.",2021-02-27,"Spirescu, Vera Alexandra; Chircov, Cristina; Grumezescu, Alexandru Mihai; Andronescu, Ecaterina",Polymers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33673451/; https://doi.org/10.3390/polym13050724,232129070.0,2021.0,220

It plays a central role in the cell under normal physiological conditions as well as during viral infections. On the one hand, the UPS can be used by the cell to degrade viral proteins, thereby restricting the viral infection. On the other hand, it can also be subverted by the virus to its own advantage, notably to induce degradation of cellular restriction factors. This makes the UPS a central player in viral restriction and counter-restriction. In this respect, the human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-1 and 2) represent excellent examples. Indeed, many steps of the HIV life cycle are restricted by cellular proteins, some of which are themselves components of the UPS. However, HIV itself hijacks the UPS to mediate defense against several cellular restriction factors. For example, the HIV auxiliary proteins Vif, Vpx and Vpu counteract specific restriction factors by the recruitment of cellular UPS components.

Severe and fatal cases of COVID-19 are often associated with increased proinflammatory cytokine levels including interleukin 6 (IL-6) and acute respiratory distress syndrome. In this study, we explored the feasibility of using plants to produce an anti-IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) monoclonal antibody (mAb) and examined its utility in reducing IL-6 signaling in an in vitro model, which simulates IL-6 induction during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The anti-IL6R mAb (IL6RmAb) was quickly expressed and correctly assembled in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Plant-produced IL6RmAb (pIL6RmAb) could be enriched to homogeneity by a simple purification scheme. Furthermore, pIL6RmAb was shown to effectively inhibit IL-6 signaling in a cell-based model system. Notably, pIL6RmAb also suppressed IL-6 signaling that was induced by the exposure of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. This is the first report of a plant-made anti-IL-6R mAb and its activity against SARS-CoV-2-related cytokine signaling.

Coronaviridae comprises a large family, of which at least seven members are known to cause respiratory diseases in humans. Coronaviruses have the ability to infect virtually all major groups of animals and, eventually, can infect humans. SARS-CoV-2 is the third coronavirus to cross the species barrier and infect humans. This virus was identified in an outbreak of pneumonia cases in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China, in December 2019. Its entire genome is inscribed on a single strand of ribonucleic acid. Some proteins present on the surface of the virus act as facilitators for its entry into host cells, while others, apparently, are related to its pathogenesis. Coronaviruses are responsible for respiratory infections in humans and some animals. The infection is often mild to moderate in intensity, but some coronaviruses may cause serious illnesses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which occurred in 2002, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Coronaviruses can activate an excessive and unregulated immune response, which may promote SARS development.

Patients undergoing cardiac surgery were randomized to BIS (n = 361) or ETAC (n = 362) guided anesthesia. Volatile anesthetic was titrated either to maintain a BIS value of 40 to 60 (BIS group), or an age-adjusted minimum alveolar concentration of 0.7 to 1.3 (ETAC group). In the ETAC group, anesthesiologists were blinded to the BIS values. In this substudy, time to tracheal extubation was compared between groups. Cox regression identified predictors affecting the instantaneous probability of tracheal extubation. RESULTS Time to tracheal extubation was not significantly different between groups (odds ratio 1.04, 95% confidence interval, 0.88-1.23, P = 0.643). In addition, group assignment did not influence the instantaneous probability of tracheal extubation (P = 0.433). Predictors decreasing the instantaneous probability of tracheal extubation included higher body mass index (P = 0.001), higher logistic EuroSCORE (P = 0.015), complex surgery type (P = 0.034), and surgery completion in the evening (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS Compared with management based on ETAC, anesthetic management based on BIS guidance does not strongly increase the probability of earlier tracheal extubation in patients undergoing fast-track cardiac surgery. The decision to extubate the trachea is more influenced by patient characteristics and perioperative course than the assignment to BIS or ETAC monitoring.",,"Villafranca, Alexander; Thomson, Ian A; Grocott, Hilary P; Avidan, Michael S; Kahn, Sadia; Jacobsohn, Eric",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0b013e31827b117e; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23400982/,19895015.0,,308
mibwvgyd,WHO,A review of spatial causal inference methods for environmental and epidemiological applications,,unk,"The scientific rigor and computational methods of causal inference have had great impacts on many disciplines, but have only recently begun to take hold in spatial applications. Spatial casual inference poses analytic challenges due to complex correlation structures and interference between the treatment at one location and the outcomes at others. In this paper, we review the current literature on spatial causal inference and identify areas of future work. We first discuss methods that exploit spatial structure to account for unmeasured confounding variables. We then discuss causal analysis in the presence of spatial interference including several common assumptions used to reduce the complexity of the interference patterns under consideration. These methods are extended to the spatiotemporal case where we compare and contrast the potential outcomes framework with Granger causality, and to geostatistical analyses involving spatial random fields of treatments and responses. The methods are introduced in the context of observational environmental and epidemiological studies, and are compared using both a simulation study and analysis of the effect of ambient air pollution on COVID-19 mortality rate.

METHODS 54 individuals with psychosis and 103 individuals without psychosis (but experiencing other severe and acute mental health issues) were compared, and analyses of indirect effects were conducted to test specificity of thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, capability for suicide, agitation, and insomnia as accounting for group differences in suicidal ideation. RESULTS Patients without psychosis experienced higher levels of suicidal ideation, perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, agitation, and insomnia than patients with psychosis. Additionally, perceived burdensomeness and agitation emerged as robust explanatory factors for the relationship between psychosis status and suicidal ideation. LIMITATIONS Future work should include longitudinal analyses to understand temporal relationships between study variables. Additionally, stability of patients' psychotic symptoms was required and therefore may not reflect those at greatest acuity. CONCLUSIONS Although several studies have investigated suicide-related variables among those with psychosis as compared to the general population, the present study is novel in that the severity of these symptoms in those with psychosis is compared to that of those in other acutely ill populations (e.g., major depression, substance use).",2021-07-18,"Lieberman, Amy; Rogers, Megan L; Graham, Adam; Joiner, Thomas E",Journal of affective disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.07.023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34303305/,236322036.0,2021.0,203

In this work, we have developed support vector machine (SVM) models to predict antiviral peptide sequences. Oscillations in physicochemical properties in protein sequences have been shown to be predictive of protein structure and function, and in the presented we work we have taken advantage of these known periodicities to develop models that predict antiviral peptide sequences. In developing the presented models, we first generated property factors by applying principal component analysis (PCA) to the AAindex dataset of 544 amino acid properties. We next converted peptide sequences into physicochemical vectors using 18 property factors resulting from the PCA. Fourier transforms were applied to the property factor vectors to measure the amplitude of the physicochemical oscillations, which served as the features to train our SVM models. To train and test the developed models we have used a publicly available database of antiviral peptides (http://crdd.osdd.net/servers/avppred/), and we have used cross-validation to train and tune models based on multiple training and testing sets.

This is particularly true for ethnic minority populations such as Latino adults for whom few culturally adapted programs have been developed and tested. Text messaging (SMS) represents a convenient and accessible communication channel for delivering targeted PA information and support, but has not been rigorously evaluated against standard telehealth advising programs. The objective of the On The Move randomized controlled trial is to test the effectiveness of a linguistically and culturally targeted SMS PA intervention (SMS PA Advisor) versus two comparison conditions: a) a standard, staff-delivered phone PA intervention (Telephone PA Advisor) and b) an attention-control arm consisting of a culturally targeted SMS intervention to promote a healthy diet (SMS Nutrition Advisor). The study sample (N = 350) consists of generally healthy, insufficiently active Latino adults ages 35 years and older living in five northern California counties. Study assessments occur at baseline, 6, and 12 months, with a subset of participants completing 18-month assessments. The primary outcome is 12-month change in walking, and secondary outcomes include other forms of PA, assessed via validated self-report measures and supported by accelerometry, and physical function and well-being variables. Potential mediators and moderators of intervention success will be explored to better determine which subgroups do best with which type of intervention.

We aimed to investigate the prevalence and factors associated with IC decline and examine associations between IC and adverse outcomes among community-dwelling older adults in China. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. SETTING: Community, China. PARTICIPANTS: Data were derived from the China Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment Study, a population-based nationally representative sample. IC comprises of five domains: locomotion, cognition, vitality, sensory and psychology. Participants were deemed to have IC decline if they showed a decline in any of the five domains. Sociodemographic characteristics, chronic diseases, geriatric syndromes and adverse outcomes were also examined. RESULTS: Of the 5823 community-dwelling participants aged 60–98 years, 2506 had IC decline (weighted 39.9%): 57.7% in western, 38.3% in northern, 33.7% in northwest, 36.1% in middle, 16.9% in eastern and 19.8% in northeast China. The number of participants with decline in the locomotion, cognition, vitality, sensory and psychological domains were 1039 (17.8%), 646 (11.1%), 735 (12.6%), 824 (14.2%) and 713 (12.2%), respectively. Age, northern residence, low education, being unmarried, low income, less exercise, less meat intake, insomnia, memory loss, urinary incontinence, constipation, slowness, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and osteoarthritis were related to IC decline. After adjusting for age, sex, area, district, marriage, education, waist–hip ratio, smoking, alcohol consumption, exercise, income and chronic diseases, IC decline was independently associated with risk of frailty, disability, falls, fractures and immobility. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of IC decline in China is high. IC decline was significantly associated with adverse outcomes, after adjustment for related variables.

METHODS A prospective cohort study enrolled 108 patients with Rutherford category 2-3 ischemia who had successful primary unilateral angioplasty and self-expanding bare metal stent implantation for superficial femoral artery (SFA) stenosis. The primary endpoint was a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke or transient ischemic attack, cardiovascular death, or >80% target lesion restenosis within 2 years after peripheral angioplasty. Target lesion restenosis (restenosis endpoint) and the composite of the aforementioned atherothrombotic events (atherothrombotic endpoint) within 2-year follow-up were defined as secondary endpoints. RESULTS CHE levels were not available in 4 patients due to technical problems and 4 patients were lost to follow-up. The remaining 100 patients (median age 65 years; 62 men) met the minimum sample size requirement for statistical analysis. Median CHE levels were significantly lower in patients who subsequently experienced the primary endpoint compared with patients without ischemic events [7.1 (IQR 6.3-8.1) vs 8 (IQR 7-9.3) kU/L, p=0.007]. A CHE level <8.3 kU/L was identified as the best cutoff value to predict the primary endpoint, providing an 82.1% sensitivity and 44.3% specificity. The primary endpoint occurred significantly more often in patients with low CHE <8.3 kU/L than in patients with higher CHE levels (32 vs 7 patients, p=0.01).

With the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic substantially interrupting control programmes worldwide, there are now mounting fears that decades of progress in controlling global parasitic infections will be undone. With Covid-19 moreover exposing deep vulnerabilities in the global health system, the current moment presents a watershed opportunity to plan future efforts to reduce the global morbidity and mortality associated with human parasitic infections. In this chapter, we first provide a brief epidemiologic overview of the progress that has been made towards the control of parasitic diseases between 1990 and 2019, contrasting these fragile gains with the anticipated losses as a result of Covid-19. We then argue that the complementary aspirations of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the World Health Organization (WHO)’s 2030 targets for parasitic disease control may be achieved by aligning programme objectives within the One Health paradigm, recognizing the interdependence between humans, animals, and the environment. In so doing, we note that while the WHO remains the preeminent international institution to address some of these transdisciplinary concerns, its underlying challenges with funding, authority, and capacity are likely to reverberate if left unaddressed. To this end, we conclude by reimagining how models of multisectoral global health governance—combining the WHO's normative and technical leadership with greater support in allied policy-making areas—can help sustain future malaria and NTD elimination efforts.",2021-10-11,"Ung, Lawson; Stothard, J.

Few studies have assessed psychological treatment in people awaiting TKA, and these have been psychologist-delivered treatments. No evidence exists regarding psychologically-informed interventions delivered by health professionals currently embedded in TKA clinical pathways. The primary aim of this pilot study is to explore the safety, acceptability and feasibility of the Knee Osteoarthritis Management with Physiotherapy informed by Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (KOMPACT) approach in people awaiting TKA. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: 51 community-dwelling adults scheduled for a primary TKA at two hospitals will be recruited to this pilot, mixed-methods, prospective randomised controlled trial with assessor blinding. Participants will be randomised in a 1:2 ratio to either usual care (education class) or usual care plus KOMPACT (2 hours 20 min of preoperative physiotherapy informed by Acceptance and Commitment Therapy). Our primary outcome measures are safety (length of stay, complications and psychological health after KOMPACT), acceptability (treatment credibility and qualitative data) and feasibility (recruitment, retention and intervention fidelity) of the KOMPACT approach. Secondary outcomes include health service outcomes, patient-reported physical and psychological outcomes, and physical performance measures. Quantitative data collection was conducted at baseline, 1–2 weeks before TKA, 6 weeks after TKA and 6 months after TKA. Qualitative data collection is 1–2 weeks before TKA. Data analysis will take a quantitative-led approach with triangulation after thematic analysis of the qualitative data.

This paper proposes two algorithms for the automatic selection of sampling locations in sewage networks. The first algorithm, is for the optimal selection of a predefined number of sampling locations ensuring maximum coverage of inhabitants and minimum overlapping amongst selected sites (static approach). The second is for establishing a strategy of iterations of sample&analysis to identify patient zero and hot spots of COVID-19 infected inhabitants in cities (dynamic approach). The algorithms are based on graph-theory and are coupled to a greedy optimization algorithm. The usefulness of the algorithms is illustrated in the case study of Girona (NE Iberian Peninsula, 148,504 inhabitants). The results show that the algorithms are able to automatically propose locations for a given number of stations. In the case of Girona, always covering more than 60% of the manholes and with less than 3% of them overlapping amongst stations. Deploying 5, 6 or 7 stations results in more than 80% coverage in manholes and more than 85% of the inhabitants. For the dynamic sensor placement, we demonstrate that assigning infection probabilities to each manhole as a function of the number of inhabitants connected reduces the number of iterations required to detect the zero patient and the hot spot areas.",2021-07-12,"Calle, Eusebi; Martínez, David; Brugués-i-Pujolràs, Roser; Farreras, Miquel; Saló-Grau, Joan; Pueyo-Ros, Josep; Corominas, Lluís",Environ Int,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2021.106768; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0160412021003937; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412021003937; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34325220/,236516484.0,2021.0,235

Unlike plasmid DNA, saRNA does not require entry into the nucleus of target cells for expression, having the capacity to drive higher protein expression compared to mRNA as it replicates within the cytoplasm. In this study, we examined the potential of stabilized native-like HIV-1 Envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimers to elicit immune responses when delivered by saRNA polyplexes (PLXs), assembled with linear polyethylenimine. We showed that Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) saRNA induces a stronger humoral immune response to the encoded transgene compared to Semliki Forest virus saRNA. Moreover, we characterized the immunogenicity of the soluble and membrane-bound ConSOSL.UFO Env design in mice and showed a faster humoral kinetic and an immunoglobulin G (IgG)2a skew using a membrane-bound design. The immune response generated by PLX VEEV saRNA encoding the membrane-bound Env was then evaluated in larger animal models including macaques, in which low doses induced high IgG responses. Our data demonstrated that the VEEV saRNA PLX nanoparticle formulation represents a suitable platform for the delivery of stabilized HIV-1 Env and has the potential to be used in a variety of vaccine regimens.",2021-06-24,"Aldon, Yoann; McKay, Paul F.; Moreno Herrero, Jorge; Vogel, Annette B.; Lévai, Réka; Maisonnasse, Pauline; Dereuddre-Bosquet, Nathalie; Haas, Heinrich; Fábián, Katalin; Le Grand, Roger; Sahin, Ugur; Shattock, Robin J.",Mol Ther Nucleic Acids,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.omtn.2021.06.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34589271/,237915710.0,2021.0,195

uqihfi66,WHO,Modification of face masks with zeolite imidazolate framework-8: A tool for hindering the spread of COVID-19 infection,,unk,"The worldwide spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has continued to accelerate, putting a considerable burden on public health, safety, and the global economy. Taking into consideration that the main route of virus transmission is via respiratory particles, the face mask represents a simple and efficient barrier between potentially infected and healthy individuals, thus reducing transmissibility per contact by reducing transmission of infected respiratory particles. However, long-term usage of a face mask leads to the accumulation of significant amounts of different pathogens and viruses onto the surface of the mask and can result in dangerous bacterial and viral co-infections. Zeolite imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) has recently emerged as an efficient water-stable photocatalyst capable of generating reactive oxygen species under light irradiation destroying dangerous microbial pathogens. The present study investigates the potential of using ZIF-8 as a coating for face masks to prevent the adherence of microbial/viral entities. The results show that after 2 h of UV irradiation, a polypropylene mask coated with ZIF-8 nanostructures is capable of eliminating S. Aureus and bacteriophage MS2 with 99.99% and 95.4% efficiencies, respectively. Furthermore, low-pathogenic HCoV-OC43 coronavirus was eliminated by a ZIF-8-modified mask with 100% efficiency already after 1 h of UV irradiation. As bacteriophage MS2 and HCoV-OC43 coronavirus are commonly used surrogates of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the revealed antiviral properties of ZIF-8 can represent an important step in designing efficient protective equipment for controlling and fighting the current COVID-19 pandemic.

Current evidence supporting their implementation and operation underestimates their usefulness by excluding skin, soft tissue and vascular infections (SSTVIs) and anoxic/toxicity-related brain injury from cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA). Our goal is to conduct a comprehensive CEA of harm reduction interventions in a setting with a large, dispersed, heterogeneous population of PWID, and include prevention of SSTVIs and anoxic/toxicity-related brain injury as measures of benefit in addition to HIV, hepatitis C and overdose morbidity and mortalities averted. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This protocol describes how we will develop an open, retrospective cohort of adult PWID living in Québec between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2020 using administrative health record data. By complementing this data with non-linkable paramedic dispatch records, regional monthly needle and syringe dispensation counts and repeated cross-sectional biobehavioural surveys, we will estimate the hazards of occurrence and the impact of Montréal’s harm reduction interventions on the incidence of drug-use-related injuries, infections and deaths. We will synthesise results from our empirical analyses with published evidence to simulate infections and injuries in a hypothetical population of PWID in Montréal under different intervention scenarios including current levels of use and scale-up, and assess the cost-effectiveness of each intervention from the public healthcare payer’s perspective. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved by McGill University’s Institutional Review Board (Study Number: A08-E53-19B). We will work with community partners to disseminate results to the public and scientific community via scientific conferences, a publicly accessible report, op-ed articles and open access peer-reviewed journals.",2021-10-26,"Panagiotoglou, Dimitra; Abrahamowicz, Michal; Buckeridge, David L; Caro, J Jaime; Latimer, Eric; Maheu-Giroux, Mathieu; Strumpf, Erin C",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-053191; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34702731/,239999969.0,2021.0,270

METHODS AND RESULTS: Blood‐monocytes and cells from mesenteric lymph nodes were obtained from pigs and cultured with live Bb12 for 4 and 12 h. Transcript levels of IL‐10 and TLR2 were analysed. Furthermore, TLR2 was blocked to determine its participation in IL‐10 production. TLR2 blockade was achieved with neutralizing antibodies, followed by stimulation with Bb12. Bifidobacteria induced IL‐10 production in both swine monocytes and mesenteric cells. Monocytes with TLR2 blockade had a decrease in IL‐10 transcripts, while mesenteric cells did not. Bacterial cell wall components were responsible for Bb12‐induced IL‐10 production since no IL‐10 was detected in the culture supernatant. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that IL‐10 production is largely mediated through the recognition of Bb12 structures by TLR2, as bacterial metabolites in the culture supernatant failed to induce IL‐10 expression.

vwcrw9ys,WHO,"Covid-19 in Slovakia: Economic, social and psychological factors of subjective well-being and depressive symptoms during a pandemic",,unk,"Objectives and hypotheses. It was expected that income and its rate of deterioration as an economic factor, insufficient opportunities to talk to others and subjective feelings of isolation as social variables, and worries about income impairment, worries related to Covid-19, low tolerance of uncertainty, rumination and catastrophizing as psychological variables, will reduce the frequency of positive experiencing, increase the frequency of negative experiencing and the number of depressive symptoms. On the other hand, personal belief in a just world and a positive reappraisal were expected to positively affect the research variables. Sample and settings. The online data collection was carried out at the end of April 2020 at the peak of the number of people affected by the disease in Slovakia. It was a stratified selection of N = 1108 persons, taking into account the proportional representation of persons from the territory of the whole republic. Statistical analysis. Variable relationships were tested using PLS-SEM (Partial Least Squares - SEM). This procedure was preferred for three reasons: the exploratory nature of complex models, the predictive orientation of models, and the measurement of multiple variables with one-item questioning. Results. Three predictors out of 16 tested had a positive relationship to the frequency of positive experiencing as an affective component of subjective well-being - subjectively assessed health, personal belief in a just world, and a positive reappraisal;rumination was in a negative relationship. Six predictors were related to the frequency of negative experiencing as an affective component of subjective well-being and to symptoms of depression - in addition to the four mentioned above, it was age and worries about income impairment: with higher age, the frequency of negative experiencing and the number of depressive symptoms decreased, and a positive relation had also variables: subjective assessment of health, personal belief in a just world and a positive reappraisal. Worries about income impairment and rumination had a relationship to the frequency of negative experiencing and depressive symptoms. Study limitations. Cross sectional research did not provide information on changes in the affective component of subjective well-being and depressive symptoms of the Slovak population as a result of the pandemic, as the obtained data could not be compared with the results of the same participants from the period before the pandemic. Although this research can be considered representative in several aspects, the validity of the findings is limited by the fact that no specific groups were included in the sample - e.g. the most vulnerable groups were medical staff and the elderly over 70 years of age. Also, those who were ill or suspected of having Covid-19 were excluded from the analysis. Finally, data collection via the Internet presupposes a certain standard of living of respondents. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Ciele a hypotézy. Cieľom štúdie bolo zistiť, aký vzťah majú ekonomické a sociálne faktory v čase vrcholenia pandémie Covid-19 k afektívnej zložke subjektívnej pohody a symptómom depresie obyvateľov Slovenska, a ako sú tieto premenné ovplyvnené subjektívne prežívanými obavami a vybranými psychologickými charakteristikami opytovaných osôb. Bolo očakávané, že príjem a miera jeho zhoršenia ako ekonomický faktor, nedostatočné možnosti rozprávať sa s inými a subjektívny pocit izolovanosti ako sociálne premenné, obavy zo zhoršenia príjmu, obavy z ochorenia Covid-19, nízka miera tolerancie neurčitosti, ruminácia a katastrofizácia ako psychologické premenné, budú znižovať frekvenciu pozitívneho prežívania, zvyšovať frekvenciu negatívneho prežívania a počet symptómov depresie. Na druhej strane bolo očakávané, že osobná viera v spravodlivý svet a pozitívne prehodnotenie budú pozitívne ovplyvňovať sledované premenné. Demografické premenné a zdravotné charakteristiky opytovaných osôb boli kontrolované. Výskumná vzorka. On-line zber výskumných dát bol realizovaný koncom mesiaca apríl 2020 v čase kulminácie počtu chorobou postihnutých osôb na Slovensku. Išlo o stratifikovaný výber N = 1108 osôb so zohľadnením proporcionálneho zastúpenia osôb z územia celej republiky - každý z ôsmich samosprávnych krajov Slovenska bol zastúpený proporcionálnym počtom opytovaných osôb (rozpätie 105-164 osôb). Výskumná vzorka bola z hľadiska zastúpenia rodu a čiastočne aj rodinného stavu vyvážená, z hľadiska veku išlo o dospelé osoby vo veku 18 až 70 rokov a z hľadiska typu ekonomickej aktivity prevažovali zamestnané osoby, resp. osoby, ktoré mali v čase výskumu vlastný príjem. Štatistická analýza. Vzťahy premenných boli testované pomocou PLS-SEM (partial least squares - SEM). Táto procedúra bola uprednostnená z troch dôvodov: exploratívna povaha komplexných modelov, predikčná orientácia modelov a meranie väčšieho počtu premenných s jedno-itemovým opytovaním. Výsledky. Prezentované sú výsledky deskriptívnej analýzy meraných premenných, evaluácia modelov merania a evaluácia testovaných modelov. Tri prediktory zo 16 testovaných mali pozitívny vzťah k frekvencii pozitívneho prežívania ako afektívneho komponentu subjektívnej pohody - subjektívne hodnotené zdravie, osobná viera v spravodlivý svet a pozitívne prehodnotenie, ruminácia bola v negatívnom vzťahu. Šesť prediktorov malo vzťah k frekvencii negatívneho prežívania ako afektívneho komponentu subjektívnej pohody a k symptómom depresie - okrem štyroch vyššie uvedených, to bol vek a obavy zo zhoršenia príjmu: s vyšším vekom frekvencia negatívneho prežívania a počet symptómov depresie klesali a pozitívny vzťah mali aj subjektívne hodnotené zdravie, osobná viera v spravodlivý svet a pozitívne prehodnotenie. Obavy zo zhoršenia príjmu a ruminácia mali vzťah k frekvencii negatívneho prežívania a depresívnej symptomatológii. Obmedzenia štúdie. Prierezový výskum neposkytol informáciu o zmenách afektívnej zložky subjektívnej pohody a symptómov depresie obyvateľov Slovenska v dôsledku pandémie, lebo získané dáta nebolo možné porovnať s výsledkami tých istých osôb z obdobia pred pandémiou. Napriek tomu, že výskum možno z viacerých aspektov považovať za reprezentatívny, platnosť zistení je obmedzená tým, že do vzorky neboli zaradené špecifické skupiny - napr. najohrozenejšie skupiny, akými bol zdravotnícky personál, staršie osoby nad 70 rokov a ďalej, z analýzy boli vylúčené osoby, ktoré boli choré na Covid-19 alebo mali na toto ochorenie podozrenie. A konečne, zber údajov prostredníctvom internetu predpokladá určitý životný štandard respondentov. Psychologické a politické indikácie sú uvedené v závere štúdie.

During routine dental procedures, they are exposed to aerosol and splatter. These airborne particles pose a great risk of transmitting contagious infections to health care workers and patients, especially in an era of social distancing due to COVID-19. The current study was conducted to evaluate contamination amount, duration, the distance of aerosol, and splatter produced after cavity preparation using a two-hole and four-hole handpiece. The study was performed on a dental manikin in a dental simulation laboratory at the College of Dentistry, King Faisal University Al Ahsa. The dental manikin was set to a reclined position to simulate the clinical operatory position of the patient for dental restorative procedures. Aerosol and splatter were collected on Grade 1 qualitative cotton cellulose filter paper. These were placed on adhesive tape extending from the headrest of the dental manikin in six different directions (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 o’clock) for up to 60 inches and on certain positions of the operator and assistant such as the chest, head, forearms, upper leg, and inside facemask. Class V cavity preparation was done by the principal investigator at a specific time of 3 min on tooth #11 using a two-hole high-speed handpiece, then on the next day, Class V cavity preparation was performed on tooth #21 by a four-hole handpiece. High volume suction was used throughout the cavity preparation. Immediately after cavity preparation, the first filter paper disc was replaced with new ones in all positions. The second set of filter papers was removed after 30 min. Transparent grids were used to count the contamination area on the filter paper disc. No statistically significant difference was found in the mean amount of aerosol and splatter produced by both handpieces, however, a statistically significant difference was found in an amount of aerosol and splatter produced at a 12, 24, and 36 inches distance immediately after cavity preparation and 30 min after cavity preparation, regardless of the type of handpiece used. It is advisable to refrain from removing the personal protective barriers immediately after the procedure within the vicinity of the dental practice.

The spatial network structure of settlements therefore imposes a fundamental constraint on the spatial distribution of the population through which a communicable disease can spread. In this analysis we use the spatial network structure of lighted development as a proxy for the distribution of ambient population to compare the spatiotemporal evolution of COVID-19 confirmed cases in the USA and China. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day/Night Band sensor on the NASA/NOAA Suomi satellite has been imaging night light at ~ 700 m resolution globally since 2012. Comparisons with sub-kilometer resolution census observations in different countries across different levels of development indicate that night light luminance scales with population density over ~ 3 orders of magnitude. However, VIIRS’ constant ~ 700 m resolution can provide a more detailed representation of population distribution in peri-urban and rural areas where aggregated census blocks lack comparable spatial detail. By varying the low luminance threshold of VIIRS-derived night light, we depict spatial networks of lighted development of varying degrees of connectivity within which populations are distributed. The resulting size distributions of spatial network components (connected clusters of nodes) vary with degree of connectivity, but maintain consistent scaling over a wide range (5 × to 10 × in area & number) of network sizes. At continental scales, spatial network rank-size distributions obtained from VIIRS night light brightness are well-described by power laws with exponents near −2 (slopes near −1) for a wide range of low luminance thresholds. The largest components (10(4) to 10(5) km(2)) represent spatially contiguous agglomerations of urban, suburban and periurban development, while the smallest components represent isolated rural settlements. Projecting county and city-level numbers of confirmed cases of COVID-19 for the USA and China (respectively) onto the corresponding spatial networks of lighted development allows the spatiotemporal evolution of the epidemic (infection and detection) to be quantified as propagation within networks of varying connectivity. Results for China show rapid nucleation and diffusion in January 2020 followed by rapid decreases in new cases in February. While most of the largest cities in China showed new confirmed cases approaching zero before the end of February, most of these cities also showed distinct second waves of cases in March or April. Whereas new cases in Wuhan did not approach zero until mid-March, as of December 2020 it has not yet experienced a second wave of cases. In contrast, the results for the USA show a wide range of trajectories, with an abrupt transition from slow increases in confirmed cases in a small number of network components in January and February, to rapid geographic dispersion to a larger number of components shortly before mobility reductions occurred in March. Results indicate that while most of the upper tail of the network had been exposed by the end of March, the lower tail of the component size distribution has only shown steep increases since mid-June.",2021-02-11,"Small, Christopher; Sousa, Daniel",Appl Netw Sci,https://doi.org/10.1007/s41109-020-00345-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33614901/,231886473.0,2021.0,500

arhu7umg,WHO,Why is it important to report early possible COVID-19 PET/CT findings in cancer patients? Explaining with a case series,,unk,"Background: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) causing a pandemic mostly results in mild symptoms; however, it can evolve into serious complications. It is emphasized that if the term from the recent anticancer treatment to the diagnosis of COVID-19 was short, the probability of serious events increased in cancer patients. Therefore, early detection of COVID-19 and prevention of serious events is very important. We aimed to investigate whether it is possible to detect COVID-19 early by positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT). Methods: We retrospectively evaluated the images and clinical findings of patients who underwent PET/CT due to malignancy and whose COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test were detected positive subsequently. Results: Eight cancer patients with positive COVID-19 PCR tests were included in the study. PET/CT revealed subpleural ground-glass opacities (GGOs) showing mild fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake that could be compatible with COVID-19 in 4 of 8 patients. The number of affected lobes ranged from 1-4. All patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 by PCR test when symptoms and/or lung findings worsened on the days after PET/CT. The time interval between the last anticancer treatment and COVID-19 diagnosis in five patients was &#8804;7 days. During the follow-up, six of the cases (75%) needed mechanical ventilation and died later. Conclusion: COVID-19 may be recognised early by detecting incidental findings in PET/CT, especially in asymptomatic cancer patients. Potential complications may be prevented by early diagnosis and anticancer therapy changes. Therefore, possible COVID-19 findings in PET/CT should be reported and the patient should be referred to relevant clinician.",,"Tekin, Duygu; Budak, Emine; Yoldas, Banu; Budak, Adnan",Indian J Cancer,,235369515.0,,250

The threat posed by COVID-19 continues and clinicians, administrators, and families need to know the life conditions associated with more psychological problems to modify them and minimize their effect on mental health. The goal was to study the life conditions of adolescents during lockdown and their association with psychological problems. A total of 226 parents of 117 girls and 109 boys (mean age: 13.9; Standard deviation: 0.28) from the community that were participants in a longitudinal study answered an online questionnaire about life conditions during lockdown and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Stepwise regression analyses controlling by previous reports of SDQ were performed. Conduct, peer, prosocial, and total problems scores increased after lockdown. After adjusting for previous measures of psychopathology, worse adolescents’ mental health during COVID-19 lockdown was associated with unhealthy activities, worsening of the relationships with others, and dysfunctional parenting style.

We aimed to characterize unit culture differences at hospitals that successfully reduced their cesarean rates compared with those that did not. METHODS A mixed methods study of California hospitals participating in a statewide initiative to reduce cesarean delivery. Participants included nurses, obstetricians, family physicians, midwives, and anesthesiologists practicing at participating hospitals. Hospitals' net change in nulliparous, term, singleton, and vertex cesarean delivery rates classified them as successful if they achieved either a minimum 5 percentage point reduction or rate of fewer than 24%. The Labor Culture Survey was used to quantify differences in unit culture. Key informant interviews were used to explore quantitative findings and characterize additional cultural barriers and facilitators. RESULTS Out of 55 hospitals, 37 (n = 840 clinicians) meeting inclusion criteria participated in the Labor Culture Survey. Physicians' individual attitudes differed by hospital success on 5 scales: best practices (P = .003), fear (P = .001), cesarean safety (P = .014), physician oversight (P <.001), and microculture (P = .044) scales. Patient ability to make informed decisions showed poor agreement across all hospitals, but was higher at successful hospitals (38% vs 29%, P = .01). Important qualitative themes included: ease of access to shared resources on best practices, fear of bad outcomes, personal resistance to change, collaborative practice and effective communication, leadership engagement, and cultural flexibility. CONCLUSIONS Successful hospitals' culture and context was measurably different from nonresponders.

Hantaan virus is second to the COVID-19 outbreak in China with seven cases positive and one death. Both RNA viruses have opposite sense as in (−) for Hantaan virus and (+) for SARS CoV2 but have similarity in the pathogenesis and relevant clinical features including dry cough, high fever, shortness of breath, and SARS associated with pneumonia and certain reported cases with multiple organ failure. Although COVID-19 has global impact with high death toll, Hantaan virus has varyingly high mortality rate between 1% and 40%. Hence, there is a need to explore novel therapeutic targets in Hantaan virus due to its rapid evolution rate in its genetic makeup which governs virulence and target host cells. This review emphasizes the importance of structural and nonstructural proteins of Hantaan virus with relevant insight from SARS CoV2. The envelope glycoproteins such as Gn, Gc, and nucleocapsid protein (N) direct the viral assembly and replication in host cells. Therapeutic treatment has similarity in using ribavirin and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation but lack of efficacious treatment in both cases of SARAS CoV2 and Hantaan virus. Therefore, potential features regarding therapeutic targets for drug discovery for Hantaan viruses are discussed herewith.

In India, the whole healthcare system was engaged in tackling the second wave of COVID-19 as a result of virus mutation. Additionally, a fungal co-infection, mucormycosis started to invade the COVID-19 patients. Mucormycosis is an acute infection, caused by an opportunistic fungus, mostly attacks the immunosuppressed, diabetic, and neutropenia patients. The other causes of infection include inappropriate use of immunosuppressive drugs, entry of Mucorales through open wounds, cancer, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, organ transplant, and malnutrition. In the recent mucormycosis outbreak in India, all the mucormycosis cases included eyesight damage, facial deformities, and even death in critical conditions. These reported mucormycosis cases in India were mostly diabetes, which were treated with immunosuppressive drugs.

METHODS: A scoping review and a review of current guidance and guidelines provided by professional bodies, representing relevant discipline groups for cancer supportive care, were conducted. RESULTS: We identified 19 papers and 23 telehealth guidance documents. The results highlight how the characteristics of patient group and healthcare provider influence the acceptability and utility of the service and establish a minimum set of preconditions. The reviews primarily examined patient-focused difficulties or issues with acceptability and efficacy, with only a minority highlighting how provider issues might also be implicated. By contrast, the guidance and guidelines described a need to address skills gaps in providing and receiving support through telehealth. CONCLUSION: The capacity and willingness of services to adapt, in the context of COVID-19, is reassuring. It is important that the impact of the move to telehealth on service quality is assessed and systems put in place to ensure sustainability, acceptability, and adaptability.

Rehabilitation Units have a crucial role in reducing disability in order to reintroduce patients in the community. AIM To characterize pulmonary function and disability status and to propose an early rehabilitation protocol in a cohort of post-acute COVID-19 patients admitted to an Italian Rehabilitation Unit. DESIGN Cross-sectional observational study. SETTING Inpatients Rehabilitation Unit. POPULATION Post-acute COVID-19 patients. METHODS Demographic, anamnestic and clinical characteristics, laboratory exams and medical imaging findings were collected for the entire cohort. Outcome measures evaluated at the admission in Rehabilitation Unit were: type of respiratory supports needed, fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2), partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), FIO2/PaO2, Barthel Index (BI), modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Dyspnoea Scale, and 6-Minute Walking Test (6-MWT). Furthermore, we proposed an early rehabilitation protocol for COVID-19 patients based on baseline FiO2. RESULTS We included 32 post-acute COVID-19 patients (22 male and 10 female), mean aged 72.6 ± 10.9 years. BI was 45.2±27.6, with patients in need of higher FIO2 (≥ 40%) showing lower values: 39.6 ± 25.7 vs 53.3 ± 29.3. All patients had grade 4 or 5 on the mMRC Dyspnoea Scale. Only 14 COVID-19 patients were able to walk (43.7%). 6-MWT was feasible in 6 (18.8%) patients with a mean distance of 45.0±100.6 meters. CONCLUSIONS Taken together, our findings suggest that post-acute COVID-19 patients suffered from dyspnoea and shortness of breath even for minimal activities, with a resulting severe disability, and only a few of them were able to perform 6-MWT with poor results.

The feasibility of rapid clinical-grade manufacturing of virus-specific T cells from convalescent donors has not been demonstrated for this or prior pandemics. Methods One unit of whole blood was collected from each convalescent donor following standard blood bank practices. After the plasma was separated and stored separately, the leukocytes were stimulated using overlapping peptides of SARS-CoV-2, covering the immunodominant sequence domains of the S protein and the complete sequence of the N and M proteins. Thereafter, functionally reactive cells were enriched overnight using an automated device capturing IFN{gamma}-secreting cells. Findings From 1x10[9] leukocytes, 0.56 to 1.16x10[6] IFN{gamma}+ T cells were produced from each of the first two donors. Most of the T cells (64% to 71%) were IFN{gamma}+, with preferential enrichment of CD56+ T cells, effector memory T cells, and effector memory RA+ T cells. TCRV{beta} spectratyping revealed oligoclonal distribution, with over-representation of subfamilies including V{beta}3, V{beta}16 and V{beta}17. With just two donors, the probability that a recipient in the same ethnic group would share at least one donor HLA allele or one haplotype could be as high as >90% and >30%, respectively. Interpretations This study is limited by small number of donors and absence of recipient data; however, crucial first proof-of-principle data are provided demonstrating the feasibility of clinical-grade production of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells for urgent clinical use, conceivably with plasma therapy concurrently.

yhnp384h,BioRxiv; WHO,Effect of prophylactic use of intra-nasal oil formulations in the hamster model of Covid-19,10.1101/2021.06.25.449990,biorxiv,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) infection initiates with viral entry in upper respiratory tract leading to coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Severe Covid-19 is characterized by pulmonary pathologies associated with respiratory failure. Thus, therapeutics aimed at inhibiting entry of the virus or its internalization in the upper respiratory tract, are of interest. Herein, we report the prophylactic application of two intra-nasal formulations provided by the National Medicinal Plant Board (NMPB), Anu oil and Til tailya in SARS-CoV2 infection hamster model. Prophylactic nasal instillation of these oil formulations exhibited reduced viral load in lungs, and resulted in reduced body weight loss and pneumonitis. In line with reduced viral load, histopathlogical analysis revealed a reduction in lung pathology in Anu oil group as compared to the control infected group. However, Til tailya group did not show a significant reduction in lung pathology. Furthermore, molecular analysis using mRNA expression profiling indicated reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines genes, including Th1 and Th17 cytokines for both the intra-nasal formulations as a result of decreased viral load. Together, the prophylactic intra-nasal application of Annu oil seems to be useful in limiting both the viral load and disease severity disease in SARS-CoV2 infection in hamster model.",2021-06-28,"Rizvi, Zaigham Abbas; Tripathy, Manas Ranjan; Sharma, Nishant; Goswami, Sandeep; Srikanth, N; Sastry, J L N; Mani, Shailendra; Surjit, Milan; Awasthi, Amit; Dikshit, Madhu",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.25.449990,235690169.0,2021.0,200
wr3anmul,WHO,REACT-1 round 13 interim report: acceleration of SARS-CoV-2 Delta epidemic in the community in England during late June and early July 2021,,unk,"BackgroundDespite high levels of vaccination in the adult population, cases of COVID-19 have risen exponentially in England since the start of May 2021 driven by the Delta variant. However, with far fewer hospitalisations and deaths per case during the recent growth in cases compared with 2020, it is intended that all remaining social distancing legislation in England will be removed from 19 July 2021. MethodsWe report interim results from round 13 of the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study in which a cross-sectional sample of the population of England was asked to provide a throat and nose swab for RT-PCR and to answer a questionnaire. Data collection for this report (round 13 interim) was from 24 June to 5 July 2021. ResultsIn round 13 interim, we found 237 positives from 47,729 swabs giving a weighted prevalence of 0.59% (0.51%, 0.68%) which was approximately four-fold higher compared with round 12 at 0.15% (0.12%, 0.18%). This resulted from continued exponential growth in prevalence with an average doubling time of 15 (13, 17) days between round 12 and round 13. However, during the recent period of round 13 interim only, we observed a shorter doubling time of 6.1 (4.0, 12) days with a corresponding R number of 1.87 (1.40, 2.45). There were substantial increases in all age groups under the age of 75 years, and especially at younger ages, with the highest prevalence in 13 to 17 year olds at 1.33% (0.97%, 1.82%) and in 18 to 24 years olds at 1.40% (0.89%, 2.18%). Infections have increased in all regions with the largest increase in London where prevalence increased more than eight-fold from 0.13% (0.08%, 0.20%) in round 12 to 1.08% (0.79%, 1.47%) in round 13 interim. Overall, prevalence was over 3 times higher in the unvaccinated compared with those reporting two doses of vaccine in both round 12 and round 13 interim, although there was a similar proportional increase in prevalence in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals between the two rounds. DiscussionWe are entering a critical period with a number of important competing processes: continued vaccination rollout to the whole adult population in England, increased natural immunity through infection, reduced social mixing of children during school holidays, increased proportion of mixing occurring outdoors during summer, the intended full opening of hospitality and entertainment and cessation of mandated social distancing and mask wearing. Surveillance programmes are essential during this next phase of the epidemic to provide clear evidence to the government and the public on the levels and trends in prevalence of infections and their relationship to vaccine coverage, hospitalisations, deaths and Long COVID.",,"Riley, Steven; Eales, Oliver; Haw, David; Wang, Haowei; Walters, Caroline E.; Ainslie, Kylie E.C.; Atchinson, Christina; Fronterre, Claudio; Diggle, Peter J.; Ashby, Deborah; Donnelly, Christl A; Barclay, Wendy; Cooke, Graham; Ward, Helen; Darzi, Ara; Elliott, Paul",Unknown,,235766659.0,,431

It has been classified as pandemic disease and more severe than predicted;with infections already recorded in a variety of countries. This study aims to confirm the COVID-19 infection through the following tests: hematological, C-reactive protein (CRP). Samples were collected from the infected patients and sent to the National Flu Center (Central Public Health Laboratory) for COVID-19 (positive or negative) diagnosis by the RT-PCR technique. In this study, sixty five of COVID-19 patients and twenty five of healthy control samples male and female were collected in Iraq. There are significant differences in the parameters of the hematological markers for patients in comparing with the control group and no significant differences were observed in Hb when RBC and GRAN percent rise in patients relative to the control group with P=0.0395 and P = 0.0354 respectively comparing with the control group. White blood cells (WBC), Lymphocyte (LYM%), Platelets (PIT), monocyte (Mid%), hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean platelet volume (MPV), plateletcrit (PCT) was drop dramatically in patients compared to control group. Fifty-one of patients for whom the test was given exhibited a positive (CRP) result. Likewise, the results showed that few patients were negative to CRP test. The Hematological parameters levels (HCT, MCV, MCH, Pelt, WBC, LYM, Mid, MPV, PCT) decreased, but Hb, RBC, GRAN% increased. C-reactive protein test showed a positive result in 85% of patients which can be considered an indicator for predicting severity infection with COVID-19.",,"Jalil, A. T.; Shanshool, M. T.; Dilly, S.
